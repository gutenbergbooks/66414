<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
WE TAKE THE FIELD AGAIN.
</h3>

<p>
While we were in quarters at Paderborn,
a mixed detachment (composed of men
for various corps) arrived to join the
army, and with it came Major Shirley,
looking quite the same as when I had
seen him last, on the morning we marched
from Wadhurst&mdash;his uniform new and
spotless, his aiguilettes glittering, his
wellfitting gloves of the whitest kid, above
which he wore pearl rings; his hair
curled and perfumed, with his handsome
figure, suave and courtly bearing, his
sinister and unfathomable smile.
</p>

<p>
He was one of those lucky fellows who
have mysterious interest (feminine
probably) at head-quarters, and who, whether
at home or abroad, are always on the staff,
and never with their regiments; thus he
had been appointed extra aide-de-camp to
Lord George Sackville, and thus we
chanced to meet on the day of his arrival
at an old windmill which did duty as a
staff-office for the British head-quarters.
</p>

<p>
"Did you see my cousin, Miss Gauntlet,
before leaving England?" I inquired,
though in reality caring little whether
he had or not.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, frequently&mdash;especially when
I was last in London; she is the reigning
toast at White's and elsewhere."
</p>

<p>
"She was well, I hope?" said I, dryly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, and looking beautiful as ever."
</p>

<p>
"Did she charge you with any message
to me?"
</p>

<p>
"None, Sir Basil.  Zounds! none, at
least, that I can remember," replied the
major, colouring.
</p>

<p>
"Is there any word of her being married
yet?" I asked, having a natural anxiety
to know <i>who</i> might next be proprietor of
my paternal acres.  "So handsome a girl,
and so rich, too, should certainly not lack
offers."
</p>

<p>
"Nor does she, 'sdeath&mdash;nor does she."
replied Shirley, as a shade of vexation
mingled with his perpetual smile.
</p>

<p>
"Aha, major," thought I; "an unsuccessful
wooer&mdash;eh!"&mdash;"And so you have no
message for me?"
</p>

<p>
"None; but I have just delivered one
of more importance than that of a London
belle&mdash;one for the army."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; we are to take the field at once,
and advance into Hesse."
</p>

<p>
"Against whom?"
</p>

<p>
"The Duc de Broglie."
</p>

<p>
On hearing this, to me, familiar name,
it was my turn to feel a tinge of vexation.
</p>

<p>
"Our muster-place is Fulda; there the
allies are to be concentrated;" and with
his constant smile which showed all his
white teeth, with his gold eyeglass in his
right eye, and his gilt spurs ringing, our
gay staff-officer left me.
</p>

<p>
As it is my object to confine these
pages as much as possible to my own
adventures, avoiding anything like a
general narrative of the war, the reader
may learn briefly, that when summoned
to the field, the Scots Greys marched to
Hesse, "through roads which&mdash;as our
records have it&mdash;no army had ever
traversed before," and encamped at Rothenburg,
in a pleasant vale, sheltered by high
hills.
</p>

<p>
In April we moved to Fulda, from
whence Prince Ferdinand began to
advance at the head of thirty thousand
men against the Duc de Broglie, whom
we found strongly posted near the village
of Bergen, which occupies a wooded
eminence between Frankfort and Hanover.
This village was defended by earthen
works, along which were rows of <i>corbeilles</i>,
as the French name those large baskets
which, on being filled with earth, are
placed close to each other, and serve to
cover the defenders of a bastion.  They
are usually eighteen inches high, and are
always wider at the top than at the
bottom; thus the opening between forms
a species of loophole, and through these
apertures the red musketry was
flashing incessantly as we came within
range.
</p>

<p>
On the 13th of April we attacked the duke.
</p>

<p>
Early in the morning our corps took
post in the line of battle; but it was
not till ten a.m. that the columns of
attack moved across the plain in front
of the French army, whose artillery
bowled long and bloody lanes through them.
</p>

<p>
"Preston," said Major Maitland, as we
formed squadrons to attack a body of
cavalry; "that column consists of at least
fifteen hundred tried men, under the
Count de Lusignan, and you have but five
hundred&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"True&mdash;but mine are <i>tried soldiers</i>,"
was the old man's proud reply; "soldiers
<i>second to none</i> in Europe."
</p>

<p>
These were no vain words, for in less
than two minutes, by one desperate charge,
we had routed them.
</p>

<p>
The grenadiers of all corps had
commenced the action, supported by us and
other dragoons, but were repulsed.
They rallied again, but were again driven
back and forced to retire, under cover of
several charges made by us and by the
Black Hussars of Prussia.
</p>

<p>
"Well done, my own hussars&mdash;and
well done the Scots Greys!" cried Prince
Ferdinand, as we re-formed after a furious
charge, without having a saddle emptied.
"Colonel Preston, you ought to be proud
of commanding such a regiment."
</p>

<p>
"<i>I am</i> proud," was the quiet reply of
our old colonel.
</p>

<p>
In all this affair, our only loss was a
single horse&mdash;mine, which was killed
under me by a six-pound shot; but Prince
Ferdinand was compelled to fall back,
leaving five guns on the field, where the
Prince of Ysembourg and two thousand
of our soldiers were slain.
</p>

<p>
By this victory the French army was
plentifully supplied with provisions of
every kind, while we suffered greatly by
the lack of food and forage.  By it, also,
their armies formed a junction and
advanced together under the command of
Maréchal de Contades, while Prince
Ferdinand, with his British and Hanoverians,
had to retire, leaving garrisons in Rothenburg,
Munster, and Minden, to cover his
retreat.
</p>

<p>
But vain were these precautions!
</p>

<p>
Rothenburg was surprised by the Duc
de Broglie; his brother the Count de
Broglie, and his nephew the Count de
Bourgneuf, "with sixteen companies of
grenadiers, one thousand four hundred
infantry, the regiments of Schomberg,
Nassau and Fischer," took Minden by
assault, and found therein ninety-four
thousand sacks of grain.  Then Munster,
though bravely defended by four thousand
men, fell after a short but sharp siege.  It
was severely, I may say savagely,
proposed by de Bourgneuf, to put all in
Minden to the sword, on the plea that the
garrison of a place taken by assault had
no right to be received as prisoners of
war; "but," as a newspaper informs us,
"General Zastrow and his men owed their
safety to the noble generosity of the Duke
and Count de Broglie."
</p>

<p>
Considering the conquest of Hanover
as certain, the court of Versailles was now
occupied mainly by considering how that
Electorate should be secured to France for
the future, when we advanced to have a
trial of strength with their armies on the
glorious, and, to us, ever memorable plains
of Minden.
</p>

<p>
Prior to this, my friend Tom Kirkton
had been promoted to the rank of cornet
and adjutant, for taking prisoner with his
own hand, during our first charge at
Bergen, the Comte de Lusignan, a
Maréchal de Camp.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap02"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
THE TWO PRESENTIMENTS.
</h3>

<p>
On the night before the action at Minden,
while we were bivouacked in a wood near
the bank of the Weser, there came under
my observation two instances of that
remarkable and undefinable emotion or
foreboding termed presentiment; and I
believe there are few men who have served
a campaign without meeting with
something of the kind among their comrades,
though the dire foreboding may not
always have been fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
One of these instances was the case of
Lieutenant Keith of ours; the other was
that of the aide-de-camp, Major Shirley.
</p>

<p>
Under a sheltering tree, and near a
large watchfire, a few of our officers,
among whom were Captain Douglas,
Keith, Tom Kirkton, Dr. Probe, and
myself, were making themselves as
comfortable as our poor circumstances would
admit.  We had plenty of wine from the
regimental sutler, "whose princely
confidence" Kirkton ironically urged us not to
abuse; we had plenty of brandy captured
from a French caisson; we had water in
plenty from a stream hard by; we had
ration beef boiled in camp kettles; we had
biscuits too; nor was Tom's usual song
wanting on the occasion, and he trolled it
so lustily that many of our men loitered
near to hear him.
</p>

<p>
We were in high spirits with the
expectation of meeting the French in the
morning; young Keith alone was sad,
melancholy, and silent, and it seemed to
me that he drank deeply, an unusual
circumstance with him.  Then suddenly he
appeared to reflect, and ceasing his
potations, resolutely passed alike the wine-jar
and the cognac bottle.
</p>

<p>
"Are you ill, Keith?" asked Douglas,
kindly.
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit of it," interrupted Tom
Kirkton; "it is only the Westphalia wine
that partially disagrees with him.  Is it
not so, friend Probe?  Try some more
brandy.  I took it from a French baggage
cart; 'tis the spoil of my sword and pistol.
Come, Jamie Keith&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "How stands the glass around?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For shame, ye take no care, my boys!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
But Keith shook his head and turned
away.
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw, boy! don't imitate any virtue of
the Spartans to-night," said Probe, our
surgeon; "who can say that we shall all
be together at this hour to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, who indeed!" muttered young
Keith, with an air so melancholy that
we all paused to observe him.
</p>

<p>
"Look at me, Keith," said Captain
Douglas, gravely; "there is something
wrong with you to-night."
</p>

<p>
"I grant you that there is," replied
the young lieutenant, turning his pale
and handsome face to the inquirer.  "I
have in my heart&mdash;and I cannot help
telling you&mdash;a solemn presentiment that
I shall not survive the battle of
to-morrow.  Yet observe me, gentlemen,
observe me well and closely all of you, and
see if I shall blench before the enemy, or
belie the name of my forefathers."
</p>

<p>
With one voice we endeavoured to
ridicule this unfortunate idea, or to
wean him from it; but he only replied
by sadly shaking his head.  After a
pause, he said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I trust that you will not laugh at
what I am about to tell you; but indeed
I care little whether you do so or not.
An hour ago, after our halt, I fell asleep
in my cloak at the foot of that tree, and
while there I dreamed of my home, of
my father's house at Inverugie.  I saw
the Ugie flowing between its banks of
yellow broom, I heard the hum of the
honeybee among the purple heather bells,
while the sweet perfume of the hawthorn
passed me on the wind.  Then I heard the
German Sea chafing on the sandy knowes
in the distance, and all the sense of
boyhood and of home grew strong within me.
But when I looked towards our old hall
of Inverugie, it was roofless and
windowless, the long grass grew on its cold
hearthstone, and there the nettle and the
ivy waved in the wind, while the black
gleds were building their nests by scores
in the holes of the ruined wall; and
that dream daunts me still.
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;why&mdash;what of it?" we asked
together.
</p>

<p>
"Because when one of our family
dreams of a gled the hour of death is nigh.
I have never known it fail, and so it has
been ever since Thomas the Rhymer sat
on a block near the castle (to this day
called the Tammas stane), and as a vision
came before him, he stretched his hands
towards the house, saying&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "When the gleds their nests shall build<br />
  Where erst the Marischal hung his shield;<br />
  <i>Then</i> Inverugie by the sea,<br />
  Lordless shall thy lands be."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
I am the last of the old line, and there is a
conviction in my heart that the prophecy
of the Rhymer is about to be fulfilled."
</p>

<p>
But for the well-known bravery, worth,
and high spirit of the young subaltern,
and the hereditary valour of the house he
represented, we might have laughed at his
strong faith in such an extremely old
prediction&mdash;a faith in which, doubtless, his
mother, his nurse, and many an old
retainer had reared him; but as it was, we
heard him in silence, till after a time,
when Douglas endeavoured to reason with
him on the folly of surrendering himself
to such gloomy impressions, but in vain.
His mind was sternly made up that he
would fall on the morrow, and that he
would die with honour to the attainted
house he represented among us&mdash;the old
lords of Inverugie and Dunotter, the earls
marischal of Scotland.
</p>

<p>
While I was thinking of this&mdash;as we
deemed it, fantastic idea&mdash;a hand was laid
on my shoulder.  I looked up and saw
Major Shirley, who requested me to
accompany him a little way apart.  I
could perceive by the light of the moon on
one hand, and that of our watchfire on the
other, that he was remarkably pale and
somewhat agitated.
</p>

<p>
"Gauntlet," said he, with a smile, but
with a very sickly one, "I have here a
letter for you."
</p>

<p>
"From whom?"
</p>

<p>
"Your cousin; a letter which I quite
forgot to deliver to you when I joined the
army in Paderborn."
</p>

<p>
"This is somewhat odd&mdash;you forgot, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly; very awkward, is it not?"
</p>

<p>
"Rather," said I, somewhat ruffled.
"Seven months have elapsed since you
came from England, and you only remember
it now!  Do you recal that you stated
she had not sent even a message to me?"
</p>

<p>
"Zounds! 'tis a fact, however odd," he
replied, calmly, and in a very subdued
voice.  "I only bethought me to-night
that the letter was in my dressing-case.
We are to be engaged to-morrow; I may
be knocked on the head as well as another,
and thus have no wish to leave even the
most trivial duty unfulfilled.  You
understand me?"
</p>

<p>
"Precisely," said I, with some
contempt of manner.
</p>

<p>
"Here is your letter&mdash;adieu.  I have
an order for the Marquis of Granby.
Where is his tent?"
</p>

<p>
"On the extreme right of the
Inniskilling Dragoons."
</p>

<p>
"Good."  He mounted and rode hurriedly
away.  I saw it all: this simpering
staff officer was in love with Aurora, and
dreaded in me a rival.  Thus he had concealed
the letter till his presentiment&mdash;shall
I call <i>his</i> emotion apprehension?&mdash;of
the coming day, impelled him to deliver
it to me.
</p>

<p>
It was sealed and bordered with black.
I tore it open and read hurriedly by the
wavering light of our watchfire.  The
whole tenor of the letter was melancholy,
and at such a time and under all the
circumstances, it moved me, though one or
two sentences were rather galling in their
purport.
</p>

<p>
Aurora informed me that she had lost
her mother at Tunbridge Wells on the
day after we sailed.  Save twice, and under
rather cloudy circumstances, I had never
seen the good lady, and so I had no tears
for the occasion.
</p>

<p>
"Dear cousin Basil," she continued,
"my father is dead; my beloved mother is
dead; my poor brother Tony and a little
sister whom I loved dearly, are also dead:
so I feel very lonely now.  The loss of
mamma has been my most severe calamity,
for she was the person in whom all my
thoughts, feelings, and anxieties centred.
You are a soldier, and I know not whether
you can feel like me&mdash;that each link of
the loving chain as it breaks unites us
closer, by near, dear, and mysterious ties,
to those who are beyond the grave&mdash;the
beloved ones who are gone, and to be with
whom would be life in death.  For a time
after poor mamma left me I felt more a
denizen of the world to come than of this,
and I feel that though dead she can still
strangely control or inspire my actions, my
emotions, and my conduct here.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, Basil, when my poor mamma
died I felt eternity <i>close</i> to me&mdash;I felt
that the circumstance of her going <i>there</i>
before me instituted a strange and
endearing tie between me and that mysterious
state of being; that my heart was drawn
towards the land of spirits; that it yearned
for the other world rather than to linger in
this.  (The deuce! thought I; is Aurora
about to take the veil&mdash;or whence this sermon?)
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me, cousin, if I weary you
with my sorrow; but to whom could I
write of it, save you?  You promised to
write to me, but have never done so.  How
unkind, after all you have said to me!
I am at present at Netherwood, where the
autumn is charming, and as I write the
sun is shining with a lovely golden gleam
on the yellow corn-fields and on the blue
wavy chain of the Cheviot Hills.  We are
cutting down a number of the old trees at
Netherwood.  (Are we really! thought I.)  Some
of these are oaks that King James
rode under on his way to Flodden Field;
and dear old Mr. Nathan Wylie
(Delightful old man!) recommends that the
ruined chapel of St. Basil in the jousting-haugh
should be removed as a relic of
Popery, which stands in the way of
the plough.  But as the saint is a
namesake of <i>yours</i>, it shall remain
untouched, with all its ivy and guelder
roses.
</p>

<p>
"When you return and visit us, as I
trust in Heaven you shall (for I never
omit to pray for your safety), you will find
wonderful improvements in the kennels,
stableyard, vinery, and copsewood."
</p>

<p>
It was very pleasant to me, a poor devil
of a cornet, half-starved on my pay,
especially since the capture of Minden, with
its 94,000 sacks of grain, by Messieurs
de Broglie and de Bourgneuf, to read
how this lovely interloper and her crusty
Mentor cut and carved on my lands
and woods, kennels and stables.
</p>

<p>
"You will regret to hear that poor Mr. Wylie
is failing fast, poor man!  His niece
Ruth&mdash;a very pretty young woman indeed&mdash;has
just had twins.  Her husband is
Bailie Mucklewham, of the neighbouring
town&mdash;a grave and rigid man, and ruling
Elder of the Tabernacle, whatever that
may be."
</p>

<p>
Ruth and her twins, and her husband
the demure Elder and Bailie!  I could
laugh now, at the boyish hour in which
I thought seriously of marrying Ruth
Wylie.
</p>

<p>
"Doubtful where to address this letter
to you, I have committed it to the care
of Major Shirley, who has been hunting
in this neighbourhood, and is now
proceeding to Germany, to join the staff of
mv Lord George Sackville.
</p>

<p>
"P.S.&mdash;Write me, dear cousin, and tell
me all about this horrible war, and if it
will soon be over.  The major is so
impatient that I have not time to read over
what I have written.  Adieu, with a kiss,
A.G."
</p>

<p>
In our comfortless bivouac, by the
sinking light of the wavering watchfire, as
I read on, Aurora's face came before me,
so charming, so fair, so blooming, and so
English.  She was warmhearted, affectionate,
and my only relative on earth, so
could I think of her in such a time of
peril otherwise than kindly?
</p>

<p>
"Can it be&mdash;I asked of myself&mdash;that I
am forgetting Jacqueline?  But wherefore
remember her now!"
</p>

<p>
Shirley had been hunting in the vicinity
of Netherwood, so I might be sure that
all his time would not have been there
devoted to the sports of the field.  Aurora
prayed for me!  It was delightful to have
some one at least who thought of
me&mdash;whose friendship or regard blessed me
and that my course in life was not
unheeded or unmarked amid the perils of
war.
</p>

<p>
Aurora might love me, if I wished;
surely there was no vanity in me to think
so?  But I feared that I could never love
her&mdash;at least as I had loved Jacqueline&mdash;for
she was the holder, the usurper of all
that should be mine.
</p>

<p>
I resolved to write to her kindly,
affectionately, after the battle, and
then I would think of her no more;
but somehow Aurora's image was
very persisting, and would not be set
aside.
</p>

<p>
I put the letter in my sabretache, and
was looking about for a soft place whereon
to sleep for an hour or so, when the sharp
twang of the trumpet sounding, and the
voice of Tom Kirkton shouting "Saddles
and boots! to horse, the Greys!" warned
me that day had broken, and that we must
stand to arms, for the bloody game of
Minden was about to begin.

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
BATTLE OF MINDEN.
</h3>

<p>
The morning of the 1st of August dawned
fair and softly.  The sky was a deep blue,
and light fleecy clouds were floating across
it.  It was the opening of a day of battle,
a day of doom to many, for who among us
were fated to fall, and who to see its close?
</p>

<p>
A gentle breeze waved the foliage of the
green woods, and swayed the ripened corn
in yellow billows as it passed over the
broad harvest-fields.
</p>

<p>
Bright, clear, and sparkling amid the
blue ether shone the morning star, and
lower down rolled a mass of amber-coloured
cloud, on the edges of which glittered the
rays of the yet unrisen sun.
</p>

<p>
Phosphor paled, the light gradually
became golden, and the last shadows of
night grew fainter as they faded away.
Then the light breeze died, and there was
not a breath to stir the foliage of the dense
old forests which cast their shadows on the
current of the Weser&mdash;that watery barrier
which the French were to defend, and we
to force at all hazards; hence, as the
morning drew on, the air became close,
heavy, and hot, and our men&mdash;horse, loot,
and artillery&mdash;while wheeling, deploying,
and getting into position among green
hedgerows and deep corn, laden as they
were in heavy marching order, soon felt
their frames relaxed and the bead-drops
oozing from under their grenadier caps and
heavy cocked hats.
</p>

<p>
Brightly the sun burst forth from amid
his amber clouds, and ere long the
embattled walls of Minden, and its Gothic
spires, Catholic and Lutheran, were
shining in light.
</p>

<p>
The allied army formed in order of
battle on the plain called Todtenhausen,
in front of the town of Minden, which
occupies the left bank of the Weser, and
in which there was a strong French
garrison, whose cannon commanded the
famous stone bridge of six hundred yards
in length.  After capturing the town from
General Zastrow, the main body of the
army of M. de Contades had encamped
near it.
</p>

<p>
On his left rose a steep hill, in his front
lay a deep morass, and in his rear flowed
a rugged mountain-stream.
</p>

<p>
As this position was strong, Prince
Ferdinand employed all his strategy to
draw the maréchal from it.  With this
view he had quitted his camp on the Weser,
and marched to a place named Hille,
leaving, however, General Wangenheim
with a body of troops entrenched on the
plain of Todtenhausen.  Then detaching
his nephew (known among us as the
Hereditary Prince of Brunswick) with six
thousand men, he gave him orders to make
a detour towards the French left, and thus
cut off their communication with Paderborn.
</p>

<p>
Though not ignorant of the compass
of these triple dispositions, Contades, the
Duc de Broglie, and Prince Xavier of
Saxony, leader of the Household Cavalry
of France, readily fell into the snare.
</p>

<p>
"Messeigneurs," said Maréchal Contades,
with confidence, "the opportunity
which we have so long sought for cutting
off Prince Ferdinand's communication
with the Weser has been found at last.
It is the very consummation of our wishes.
Already we may behold those vainglorious
allies divided and separated in three masses
without the possibility of a reunion.  Let
us march, gentlemen, and by the ruin of
General Wangenheim, obtain the full
command of the Weser!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Vive le Roi!</i>" cried the whole council
of war.
</p>

<p>
It was with this idea in their minds that
we saw the French troops leaving their
strong position between the hill, the long
and impassable morass, and the rugged
stream, and advancing into the open
plain&mdash;precisely the same fatal error committed
about a hundred years before by the Scots
at the battle of Dunbar.
</p>

<p>
The allied army, composed of fifty-nine
squadrons of horse and forty-three
battalions of infantry, with forty-eight
12-pound field-pieces and four mortars, was
formed in three lines.
</p>

<p>
We, the Scots Greys, were in Elliot's
brigade of Lord Granby's Cavalry Division,
and with the 3rd Dragoon Guards
(Howard's) and 10th Dragoons
(Mordaunt's) were on the extreme right of
the second line, when we formed up from
open column of squadrons through fields
of hemp and flax.
</p>

<p>
In our front were the Horse Guards
(Blue) and Inniskilling Dragoons, who
formed the right of the first line.
</p>

<p>
Over those thousands forming in order
of battle the shadow of death was passing;
but no thought had we then, save of
victory and triumph, and of regilding our
lost laurels!
</p>

<p>
"There will be rough work to-day&mdash;Auld
Geordie has his buff-coat on," I heard
our men muttering.
</p>

<p>
As the kettledrums beat and the
trumpets sounded the usual flourish when
swords were drawn, old Preston looked
along our glittering line with a grim
smile of satisfaction on his wrinkled
visage.
</p>

<p>
"They have unsheathed as one man!"
exclaimed Lord Granby, approvingly.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis well, my lord," said Colonel
Preston, "for those swords have killed
as many Frenchmen as any blades in
Europe."
</p>

<p>
As yet all was still&mdash;not a shot had
stirred the morning air; but we knew that
the French were advancing, as from time
to time the sky-blue colours, with the
golden lilies and the steady gleam of
bayonets appeared among the trees, the
hedges, and broken ground in front.
</p>

<p>
James Keith of Inverugie was near
me.  He was smiling now, and there was
a bright flush on his cheek with a feverish
restlessness in his eye, for the belief in
the old prediction was stronger than ever
in his heart, and I pitied the poor lad,
for he was brave as a Bayard or a Du
Guesclin.
</p>

<p>
Ere long a noisy murmur&mdash;the hum of
expectation&mdash;passed along the first line,
when eight battalions of French&mdash;the
vanguard, which was led by the Duc de
Broglie (who was mounted on a splendid
white horse with housings flashing in the
sun), and which had passed the Weser at
midnight, after marching on with perfect
confidence until they reached the crest of
an eminence, halted simultaneously, on
finding to their astonishment the whole
army of the allies now acting in unison,
disposed in excellent order, and formed in
three lines, the first of which reached
almost to the gates of Minden, and
covered the entire plain of Todtenhausen!
</p>

<p>
A discovery so unexpected filled the
Duke with embarrassment; but it was too
late to retreat.
</p>

<p>
"St. Denis for France!" he exclaimed,
waving his baton, and ordered the Cavalry,
which had covered his advance, to charge.
Thus, in five minutes, the battle began in
all its fury about six o'clock, A.M.: a battle
in describing which I shall generally
confine myself to a few personal episodes.
</p>

<p>
On the Hanoverian Guards and the six
regiments of British Infantry&mdash;our brave
12th, 20th, 23rd, 25th, or Edinburgh,
37th, and 51st&mdash;fell the chief fury of the
action.  They were all formed in one
division, protected by a brigade of British
artillery under Captains Drummond and
MacBean; and we writhed in our saddles
when we saw them knocked over like
nine-pins&mdash;their red coats dotting all the green
plain in our front; and yet no order was
given for us to advance and support them.
</p>

<p>
After repulsing the French Infantry
they were assailed by a column of Swiss,
with whom they exchanged several volleys
at twenty yards distance.
</p>

<p>
Shoulder to shoulder they stood, our
splendid British Infantry, the rear-ranks
filling up the gaps in front, the men never
pausing under fire, save to wipe their
pans, renew their priming, or change their
flints, for none would fall to the rear.  In
the words of the old ballad&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "So closing up on every side,<br />
  No slackness there was found,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
amid the fierce roar of musketry and the
clouds of smoke which enveloped all the
plain.  Colonel Kingsley, at the head of
a Cavalry regiment on our left, had two
officers shot dead by his side, two horses
killed under him, and he received a musket
ball through his hat.
</p>

<p>
Now the French brought up several
<i>batardes</i>, as they term their eight-pounders,
and the range of these extended to us, the
cavalry of the second line.
</p>

<p>
Almost immediately after these guns
opened, I heard a half-stifled scream near
me, and turning, saw Keith doubled in
two, and falling from his horse mortally
wounded and dying.  A cannon-ball had
torn away his bowels, and my heart was
wrung on seeing him gasping beneath my
horse's feet, while the memory of the
prediction flashed upon me.  He died in a
few minutes.
</p>

<p>
The great aim of the French marshals
was now to drive in or destroy either flank
of the allies.  In endeavouring to effect
this object, a charge of cavalry was made.
The Household Troops of France, most of
whom were noblesse, the red, grey, and
black mousquetaires, with the carabiniers
and gendarmerie, came boldly on.  They
were led by Prince Xavier of Saxony,
brother of the Queen of France, a brave
soldier, distinguished by his bearing, his
splendid uniform, which was covered with
orders, his sparkling diamond star and
piebald charger.  Forcing a passage, sword
in hand, through the flank of our first
line, he was advancing towards us, re-forming
his glittering squadrons as they came
on, when by order of the Marquis of
Granby, we advanced to repel them.
</p>

<p>
I saw old Preston's withered cheek
redden with stern joy, and his sunken eye
sparkle brightly, as he rapidly formed us in
open column of squadrons at the usual
distance of twenty-four feet between each other.
</p>

<p>
"Forward, my lads!  Keep your horses
well in hand&mdash;no closing&mdash;no crowding.
March!"
</p>

<p>
But when we began to move, the ordinary
distance from boot-top to boot-top
between the files became closer and
denser, till we formed as it were a
ponderous mass of men and horses wedged
together.
</p>

<p>
"Trot!" cried the colonel; then followed,
"Gallop&mdash;CHARGE!"
</p>

<p>
His voice blended with the trumpet's
twang; there was a rush of hoofs,
a hard breathing of men and horses,
a rustling of standards and rattle of
accoutrements, as we rushed with uplifted
swords and with a wild hurrah upon the
recoiling foe.
</p>

<p>
We trod them down like the hemp-field
over which we spurred; and in that
dreadful shock, down went mousequetaire,
gendarme, cuirassier, and we made a horrid
slaughter of the French Household Troops.
</p>

<p>
The colonel of the Mousquetaires Gris,
an old officer, whose breast was covered
with stars and medals, was pistolled by
one of our corporals; and Prince Xavier
of Saxony, separated from his discomfited
column, found himself engaged in a
hand-to-hand conflict with Hob Elliot.
</p>

<p>
Aware of the vast difference between
them in strength and stature, worthy
Hob Elliot tried to spare and capture the
Prince, of whose rank he was ignorant,
and who was a very little man; but he
resisted bravely, and gave our poor Borderer
several severe sword-cuts.  Hob at last
lost all patience, cut him down, and was
about to capture him by the collar, when
a stray shot struck the unfortunate
Prince, who fell dead from his horse.
</p>

<p>
This occurred immediately in front of
our 51st Foot.
</p>

<p>
While we waged this conflict on the
right, the valour of the Prussian and
Hanoverian Dragoons under the Prince
of Holstein and others on our left,
repulsed the enemy, and compelled them
to seek safety in a flight which soon
became general along the whole line,
despite every effort of the Duc de Broglie
and Maréchal de Contades.
</p>

<p>
"It was at this instant," says an
historian of the war, "that Prince
Ferdinand sent orders to Lord George
Sackville, who commanded the British and
Hanoverian Horse which composed the
right wing of the allies, to advance to the
charge.  If these orders had been
cheerfully obeyed, the battle of Minden would
have been as decisive as that of Blenheim.
The French army would have been
utterly destroyed, or totally routed and
driven out of Germany.  But whatever
was the cause, the orders were not
sufficiently precise, were misinterpreted, or
imperfectly understood."
</p>

<p>
The cause of the misfortune was this.
</p>

<p>
We had just re-formed after repelling
the Household Cavalry, when Major
Shirley, minus his cocked-hat and kid
gloves, and what was more, his presence
of mind, looking ghastly pale and wild,
and so agitated apparently that he could
scarcely articulate, rode up to Colonel
Preston (who was sitting on his old horse
as cool as a cucumber, with the bullets
whistling about him), and inquired for
Lord George Sackville, whose whereabouts
the colonel indicated, by pointing
with his sword to a horseman whose
aspect was somewhat shadowy amid the
eddying smoke.
</p>

<p>
Shirley's conventional smile had
vanished now, and he rode hurriedly on.
His instructions were to order the whole
line of cavalry to pursue; but this message
in his then state of mind he failed to
deliver, and hence the omission of an
immediate cavalry advance&mdash;a miscarriage
for which Lord George Sackville, after
being victimized by the public press, had
to appear before a general court-martial.
</p>

<p>
Shirley's undisguised panic was, however,
unnecessary, as <i>his</i> presentiment was
not fulfilled, and he escaped untouched
amid the horrors of a field whereon lay
one thousand three hundred and ninety-four
officers and men of our six British
infantry regiments <i>alone</i>, and I know not
how many of our allies.
</p>

<p>
Two thousand French were hurled at
the bayonet's point into the Weser, and
five thousand more, with Princes Xavier
and De Camille, were left dead upon the
plain, with many standards and forty-three
pieces of cannon.  On some of the latter
I saw "25th and 51st Foot" chalked, to
indicate that these corps had taken them.
The Comte de Lutzelbourg and the
Marquis De Monti, two maréchaux-de-camp,
were captured by the Greys.
</p>

<p>
The passage of the fugitives across the
Weser was a scene of horror.
</p>

<p>
Beside the stone bridge already
mentioned, the French engineer, M. Monjoy,
had chained across the stream two
pontoons, which broke under the weight
of the passers; thus many waggons full of
wounded officers were swept away by the
current, and the flower of the Cavalry,
particularly the Carabiniers and
Mousquetaires, were destroyed.
</p>

<p>
Amid the shrieks, the cries, the scattered
shots that filled the air, we heard
the hoarse hurrahs of the advancing
Germans, with the clear ringing cheers of
the British, and the shouts of "Forward
with the Light Bobs and Buffers&mdash;support
the Tow-rows!"
</p>

<p>
The latter was the nickname of the
Grenadiers in those days, and they in turn
named the battalion men "buffers," or
"mousers" in the militia; while the
"Light Bobs" were the pet company of
every corps, being always the smartest and
most active men.
</p>

<p>
The town of Minden surrendered with
five thousand men, the half of whom were
wounded.  By sunset the whole of our
cavalry were gone in pursuit, save our
Light Troop, which, with a few Prussian
Hussars, remained on the field to protect
the wounded, to patrol after plunderers,
and oversee the working parties who
interred the dead.
</p>

<p>
In the activity of that pursuit old
Colonel Preston surpassed every other
officer.  He actually took the Greys <i>two
hundred</i> miles from the field, and captured
a vast number of prisoners.*
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* "Regimental Records."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Part of the military chest, with all the
equipages of Maréchal de Contades and
the Prince of Condé fell into his
hands&mdash;prizes of no inconsiderable value.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
PRINCE XAVIER OF SAXONY.
</h3>

<p>
The Light Troop had gone more than a
mile from the field with the pursuing
cavalry before it was ordered to return on
the service just stated.  When falling
back, we passed through a hamlet where
the baggage of our brigade was lying,
and there we were surrounded by our
soldiers' wives, clamorously inquiring for
tidings of the past day.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, please your honour, gude sir,"
cried one, holding her baby to her bare
breast with one hand, while the other
clung to my stirrup-leather, her eyes
streaming with tears the while; "can
you tell us if the regiment has been
engaged, for heavy has the firing been all
day?"
</p>

<p>
"Have the Greys suffered&mdash;have the
Greys suffered?"
</p>

<p>
"Did you see my puir gudeman&mdash;he
is in the 1st troop&mdash;John Drummond,
sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Shot&mdash;my poor Willie shot!" shrieked
another.  "Then God help his puir bairns
and me in this waefu' country, for we
ne'er shall see the bonnie Braes o' Angus
again!"
</p>

<p>
Such were some of the cries I heard on
all sides as we hurried through the hamlet
at a trot, and returned to the field on
which the moonlight had succeeded the
long level flush of the set sun.
</p>

<p>
There lay all the usual amount of death
and agony&mdash;the sad paraphernalia of war&mdash;and
the pale dead in every variety of
attitude and contortion, so close to each
other that in some places one might have
stepped from body to body.
</p>

<p>
Already had many been stripped nude
as when they came into the world by
those wretches who hover like carrion
crows on the skirts of an army; and their
pale marble skins gleamed horribly white
with their black and gaping wounds in
the cold moonlight.
</p>

<p>
Amid these many horrors&mdash;the dying
and the dead, legs, arms, blood-gouts and
spattered brains&mdash;some phlegmatic German
infantry were quietly bivouacking and
lighting fires to cook their supper.  Others
lay down weary and worn, their mouths
parched with thirst, and their canteens
empty, after twelve hours' marching and
fighting.
</p>

<p>
As we rode slowly over the field to
scare plunderers and protect the wounded,
I heard, amid a group of officers whom
we passed, one laughing loudly, and
found him to be Major Shirley.  A
revulsion of feeling made the flow of this
man's spirits extravagant; and here, amid
the rows and piles of dead and wounded&mdash;amid
the expiring on that solemn, harrowing,
and moonlighted plain&mdash;he was
joking and laughing, like a fool or a
drunkard&mdash;he, the poltroon who could
not articulate an order when under a fire
at noon!
</p>

<p>
"<i>His</i> weird is no come yet," I heard
old Sergeant Duff mutter as we rode on
in extended order, our horses sometimes
stumbling over what appeared to be a
heap of freshly gathered grain or hemp.
These had been uprooted by some kind
hand, and spread over a dead comrade to
protect or conceal his body from
plunderers; and everywhere lay fragments of
exploded shells and the half imbedded
cannon-shot that had ploughed up the
grass or corn in long furrows.
</p>

<p>
We sought for and interred, separately,
in his cloak, the body of poor Keith, our
young lieutenant.  Elsewhere the dead
were rapidly interred; some by lantern-light,
and with them, undistinguished
among the rank and file, Prince Xavier
of Saxony.
</p>

<p>
One soldier of our 51st got his diamond
star, and sold it to a Jew for some
hundred pounds, which he spent in six months,
keeping the regiment in an uproar while
the money lasted; another got his purse,
which was filled with louis d'ors; and a
third 51st man got his watch, which was
studded with brilliants.  Some Westphalian
boors then stripped the body, which
was flung into a pit and interred with
about twenty others.
</p>

<p>
All the churches in Minden and its
vicinity were converted into hospitals.
The interior of the old Cathedral&mdash;whither
I rode to inquire after Hob Elliot and
some others of ours&mdash;presented a very
singular scene.  It is a dark but stately
edifice, said to have been formerly the
palace of the Pagan King Wittikind, but
was turned by him into a church after
his conversion.
</p>

<p>
Along the high-arched Gothic aisles
were rows of wounded soldiers&mdash;British,
French, and Hanoverian&mdash;groaning, praying,
cursing, and rustling fretfully among
the bloody straw on which they lay.
Knapsacks, haversacks, and accoutrements
hung on every carved knob, and there
was not a saint who did not bear a load
of sword-belts, bridles, or canteens slung
about his neck or piled within his niche,
while, in the Gothic porch, the
chapter-house, and the painted chapel of Our Lady
of Minden, stood surgeons' blocks for
operations; and there were Dr. Probe and
all the medical men of the army busy
in their shirt-sleeves with knife and saw,
and up to their bared elbows in blood.
</p>

<p>
There was no time, nor was it then the
fashion to reduce fractures; so around
each military Æsculapius lay piles of legs,
arms, hands, and feet, amputated as fast
as their owners could be brought from
the field; and these revolting fragments
were cast into a corner until they could
be carted away to the pits that were being
dug by our working parties amid the
harvest-fields on the plain of Todtenhausen.
</p>

<p>
But such is war, and such are its grim
concomitants.
</p>

<p>
On the noon of the day after the battle
I was returning from the visit to this hospital,
or cathedral, and was proceeding to
rejoin the Light Troop which was bivouacked
in a hemp-field at some distance from the
pits where the dead lay, when two French
officers and a trumpeter, all mounted, and
accompanied by six dragoons, came
suddenly upon me at an angle of the road.
</p>

<p>
As one bore a white banner on a sergeant's
pike, I recognised at once a flag
of truce, so we simultaneously reined up
and courteously saluted each other.  One
wore the gorgeous uniform of Colonel of
the Regiment de Bretagne; the other was
a French Hussar officer, in whom I
recognised the Chevalier de Boisguiller.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Peste! monsieur,</i>" said he, "you and
I have the luck of meeting in strange
places, but seldom under pleasant
circumstances.  We are in haste, for those we
have left behind are not likely to wait for
us, pressed as they now are by your
cavalry; so, can you direct us to the
quarters of Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick?"
</p>

<p>
"With pleasure.  You are the bearer&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, my friend Monsieur le Comte is
bearer of a letter from the Maréchal de
Contades, our commander-in-chief, to the
Prince, inquiring into the fate of Prince
Xavier of Saxony."
</p>

<p>
"His fate?" I repeated, and shook my head.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Oui, monsieur,</i>" said the officer, who
bore the rank of count, with great
earnestness; "if he is wounded we come to offer
a suitable equivalent in exchange for him;
if, unhappily, killed, to solicit the
restoration of his remains, for he is the brother
of her Majesty the Queen of France, and
I had the honour to be his particular
friend."
</p>

<p>
While we were speaking, a royal coach
and six, accompanied by a squadron of
French Household Troops, preceded by an
officer bearing a white flag, and by four
trumpeters, wheeled round the angle of
the road and joined us.
</p>

<p>
"Here comes the Prince's carriage,
with Monsieur Monjoy to receive him,
whether dead or alive," said Boisguiller.
</p>

<p>
With some reluctance I informed these
officers that I had seen the Prince cut
down by one of our own troopers, and
almost immediately afterwards pierced by
a ball in front of the grenadier company
of our 51st Foot; and that his body had
been buried with others on the field.
</p>

<p>
This information filled the Frenchman
with a sorrow that seemed genuine; and
the colonel of the Regiment de Bretagne,
a handsome, but stern-looking young man,
actually wept aloud.
</p>

<p>
Prince Ferdinand, to whose quarters I
conducted them, gave orders to open some
of the pits in the field; so a working
party was detailed, and a search instituted
among the naked and mangled dead for
the body of the unfortunate Prince.
</p>

<p>
No less than eighty of these horrid
graves were unclosed, and their poor
occupants pulled by the legs or arms from
among the mould and examined before the
discovery of the Prince's piebald charger
in one hecatomb gave hope that his late
rider's remains might be near; and
accordingly, in one that was filled with
Mousquetaires Gris et Noires, we found
a nude and bloody corpse, which all the
French officers at once declared to be
Prince Xavier of Saxony, stripped even to
his boots.
</p>

<p>
He had received a bullet in the left
temple, which was his mortal wound.
His right arm was found to be broken.
This had been done by the sword of Hob
Elliot.  His fine hair was still neatly
dressed, tied by a blue satin ribbon, and
powdered with brown <i>maréchale</i>.
</p>

<p>
The poor remains were rolled in a large
crimson velvet mantle, bearing a royal star,
and placed in the coach, which was driven
rapidly off, followed by its escort, to which
all our guards, sentinels, and out-pickets
presented arms.

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
THE BRIDGE OF FREYENTHAL.
</h3>

<p>
Severe weather succeeded the battle of
Minden, and the Scots Greys, while it
continued, were ordered to cantonments
in villages near the Lahn.
</p>

<p>
On a dull wet morning we paraded in
our cloaks and bade adieu to the banks of
the Weser, and to the fatal plain of the
1st of August.  By sound of trumpet we
fell into our ranks, and the corporal-major
of each troop proceeded to call the muster-roll.
</p>

<p>
Alas! there was called over on that
morning the name of more than one
brave fellow who could respond to it no
more, and over whom the autumn grass
was sprouting.
</p>

<p>
Amid the snows of winter we idled
away our time in those dreary villages of
Prussian Westphalia, till Major Shirley
arrived with a message of a peculiar nature
for Colonel Preston.
</p>

<p>
Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, to
whose staff the major was now attached
(Lord Sackville having been summarily
dismissed the service by the king), sent
him to inform the colonel that in the
district named the Rodhargebirge, a
certain baron named Conrad of
Freyenthal&mdash;whose character would have suited
admirably one of Anne Radcliffe's
romances&mdash;had placed his wife in a dungeon
or vault of his residence, and kept her a
prisoner therein, while a mistress occupied
her place, as the ballads say, "in bower
and hall."  The orders of his royal
highness were, that we should send a party
there to free and protect the lady, and
also to blow up a bridge of the Lahn close
by Freyenthal, which had been partially
undermined already by M. Monjoy, an
engineer of the French rear-guard already
mentioned.
</p>

<p>
Guided by a peasant, Colonel Preston
went with the Light Troop in person on
this service, and as it was not likely to be
a desperate one, Major Shirley accompanied
us, and contrived to play me a
trick which I had reason long to remember.
</p>

<p>
We marched from our cantonment an
hour before daybreak, when the sharp
crescent moon was waning coldly behind
the hills, and the bronze-like conical outlines
of the fir-trees cut acute angles against
the clear blue sky.  After passing through
a wooded defile in the mountains, we
reached the castle of Freyenthal, a small
square tower, surrounded by a barbican
wall, and perched on an insulated mass of
rock, at the base of which the Lahn
poured over a great cascade, that was then
almost a mass of icicles.
</p>

<p>
Close by this tower the river was
spanned by the ancient stone bridge
which we had such special orders to blow up.
</p>

<p>
Before this feudal fortress we sounded
a trumpet thrice, but met with no
response, and could see no one, nor any
sign of life about the place, save the dark
smoke that ascended from the chimneys
into the clear winter sky.  The arched
gate of the outer wall was strong, and
being securely barred within, defied all our
efforts.
</p>

<p>
While ten of our men dismounted,
and under the order of a German engineer
officer proceeded to examine and make
use of the old French mine under one of the
piers of the bridge, Colonel Preston, whose
temper was apt to be chafed by trifles,
deliberately blew up the gate of the tower
by a petard which he had brought for the
express purpose.
</p>

<p>
Roused from his apathy or his potations
by this unexpected explosion, the
proprietor of Freyenthal, a stern-looking
man, with powdered hair, a hooked nose,
and fierce, black, bushy eyebrows, rushed
bareheaded and unarmed into the courtyard,
accompanied by two or three men-servants
of bloated and forbidding appearance.
</p>

<p>
Then Colonel Preston in a few words
acquainted him with the orders of Prince
Ferdinand of Brunswick, and required the
immediate surrender of the baroness&mdash;our
errand and intention.  But, undaunted by
the colonel's rank and the aspect of his
troop of horse crowding all the pathway
that led to the tower, the baron roughly
taunted him with "unwise interference in
domestic affairs, and with being an insolent
braggart to boot."
</p>

<p>
On hearing this, the fiery old man
leaped from his horse, tossed its bridle to
an orderly, and drawing his sword, offered
the baron the use of another, as well as of
a pistol, saying&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I scorn to take advantage of any
man&mdash;we are now on equal terms."
</p>

<p>
The German uttered a hoarse oath,
snatched the pistol, cocked it, and fired
straight at the head of Colonel Preston,
who would undoubtedly have been shot
had I not struck the barrel up with my
sword.  At the same instant our trumpeter,
who was close by the colonel, struck the
would-be assassin to the earth by a blow
of his trumpet.
</p>

<p>
The wife of this most irritable Teuton
we found exactly in the plight Shirley
had described, immured in a vault, a cold
and miserable place, the sole furniture of
which was a truckle-bed.  We put the
baron in her place, and sent her by her
own request, to the Lutheran Convent at
Marburg, while her rival was made to ride
the <i>cheval de bois</i> for an hour, with a
carbine slung at each foot.
</p>

<p>
While the baron's Westphalian wine and
beer were freely brought from his cellar
for the use of the troop; while he growled
and swore in his vault, and while the
bridge of the Lahn was being undermined,
Colonel Preston desired me to take ten
men with me, and ride a mile or two
into the country on the other side of
the river, to reconnoitre the district, to see
or inquire about the disposition of the
enemy, but to avoid all risk.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Gauntlet," said Shirley, as I
tightened my waistbelt and put my foot
in the stirrup; "take a parting cup ere
you go."
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me, major," said I, coldly; "I
have had wine already&mdash;and the hour is
not yet noon."
</p>

<p>
"Toast Miss Gauntlet, man&mdash;Zounds! here
in Westphalia, so far away from Old
England.  To your fair cousin's health!"
he exclaimed, holding out a silver-rimmed
horn of wine.
</p>

<p>
"To Aurora, then!" said I, and drained
the wine, after clinking our horns
together in true German fashion, while
Shirley's usual smile expanded into a
laugh, and when he laughed it always
portended mischief.
</p>

<p>
"Come, my lads," said I, to my chosen
ten; "forward&mdash;trot!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't ride too far, Gauntlet," cried
Shirley, still laughing loudly, "for the
bridge is quite undermined."
</p>

<p>
"How that fool laughs at his own folly,"
thought I, as we crossed the antique
bridge at a hard trot, and rode into the
frozen country beyond.  From the bank
of the Lahn the ground sloped gradually
upward for miles, though intersected here
and there by thickly wooded ravines;
thus, as we traversed the snow, when
looking back we could distinctly see the
old tower of Freyenthal, standing dark
and grim with its smoky chimneys above
the half-frozen river.
</p>

<p>
The country seemed partially deserted,
and any peasants or woodcutters who saw
us, fled at our approach, and concealed
themselves.  We rode several miles, and
by the wayside passed the ruins of many
roofless cottages and deserted farms; but
now Hob Elliot assured me that in the
clear frosty air he "more than once had
heard the rumble of wheels&mdash;perhaps of
artillery."
</p>

<p>
As we saw nothing even in the most
distant portion of the level and snow-clad
landscape, I ridiculed this notion; but
Hob was obstinate, and stuck to his fears
on the subject.
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me, sir," said he, "but I know
that I may take the liberty of talking to
you, for when I lay in hospital at Minden,
wounded, sick, and dying as I thought,
no hand was more ready than yours to
help me.  Never did my auld mother at
hame, when I was a yellow-haired bairn,
tread mair lightly by my cradle than you
did by my straw pallet, to see that I took
those devilish draughts of old Drs. Blackstrap
and Probe of ours."
</p>

<p>
"But what about all that now, Hob?&mdash;to
the point."
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, if I might recommend&mdash;I'm
an older soldier than you&mdash;we should go
threes about now, and get back, for the
bridge is undermined, and that Major
Shirley&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well?" said I, as Hob paused.
</p>

<p>
"He had a queer twinkle in his eye as
we rode off."
</p>

<p>
"What, Hob&mdash;you do not mean&mdash;you
cannot insinuate&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me, sir," said the big burly
trooper, lowering his voice; "but he
laughed in the faces of the dead at
Minden&mdash;faces that in life he was grave enough
before, and I dinna like a bane in his
body."
</p>

<p>
"Come, come, Hob, you must not speak
in this way to me.  The major is esteemed
a good officer."
</p>

<p>
"I know that, sir," replied the trooper,
dryly; "but by whom?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," said I, impatiently, "by whom?"
</p>

<p>
"The worst men in the army."
</p>

<p>
"Hum&mdash;he is a brave man at all events, Hob."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir&mdash;we all saw that when he
bungled the orders for Lord George Sackville
at Minden, and cost the poor general
his commission&mdash;he that was there under
fire, as brave as a lion, in the old red
coat that he had worn at Fontenoy."
</p>

<p>
"Good or bad, Hob, brave or not, it is
perilous work for you to speak thus of an
officer."
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, I beg your pardon," replied
the obstinate trooper, "but I can't help
having my own thoughts of him, and
they are <i>unco queer ones</i>."
</p>

<p>
Just as he said this we reached the
brow of an eminence, over which the road
dipped suddenly down into a hollow; and
there just beneath us, we saw a train of
some thirty laden waggons, proceeding
leisurely under an escort of at least three
companies of French troops, the <i>Volontaires
de Clermont</i>.  Thus the rumble of
wheels so long heard by Hob, was now
completely accounted for!
</p>

<p>
The French uttered a shout on beholding
us, and proceeded to handle their
muskets, by priming, loading, and casting
about, while we wheeled round our horses
and departed without further ceremony
to reach the bridge of Lahn.
</p>

<p>
A hundred or more of the French
tossed aside their knapsacks, haversacks
and everything that might encumber
them, and rushed up the slope to the crest
of the eminence.  Here they poured a
confused volley after us which did no
harm, but I could see the bullets ripping
up the frozen snow far in front.  Then
with a yell the Volontaires dashed after us
in pursuit.
</p>

<p>
A partial thaw, which had been setting
in, made portions of the snow-covered
road deep and heavy, but we soon left
the French infantry far in our rear,
though they continued to follow us double
quick, determined to have a little shooting
if possible, as they had enjoyed none since
the day of Minden.
</p>

<p>
We soon distanced them more than a
mile, and ere long saw the tower of
Freyenthal dotted with the red coats of
our comrades, and with rather anxious
eyes I measured the long slope that lay
between us and the bridge, where we
could see our working party, now that
their mining task was over, sitting on the
parapets in their shirt sleeves, and
conversing.  Near them, on horseback, was
an officer, in whom, by his kevenhüller
hat and scarlet feather, I had no difficulty
in recognising Major Shirley.
</p>

<p>
As we came on at a hand-gallop, we
suddenly saw a commotion among our men
at the bridge as they pointed towards the
enemy.  Then Shirley seemed to gesticulate
violently, and order them to fall
back, waving a match which he had
snatched from one of them, and which was
smoking in his hand.
</p>

<p>
We saw him stoop from his saddle and
fire the train!
</p>

<p>
In a minute after this there was a roar
in the still air; amid a cloud of dust and
smoke the old bridge of the Lahn rose
bodily aloft, almost in a solid mass, and
then sank in foam and ruin among the
blocks of melting ice that rolled over the
cascade below.
</p>

<p>
"Treachery!" cried Hob Elliot, shaking
his clenched and gauntleted hand; "he
has blown up the bridge and cut off our
retreat!"
</p>

<p>
In another moment we all reined up
our breathless horses at the edge of the
steep rocks, through which the swollen
winter stream was roaring and boiling in
its mad career towards the Rhine.
</p>

<p>
"In the name of Heaven," I exclaimed,
filled with anger and apprehension, "why
has this been done?  Rascals, who ordered
this?&mdash;you have ruined us."
</p>

<p>
"Major Shirley is alone to blame, sir,
not we," replied a sergeant on the other
side, saluting me as he spoke; and though
the black stream that roared between us
was only thirty yards broad, the nature of
its banks and its force defied all attempts
to cross by swimming.
</p>

<p>
"It is most unfortunate, my dear
Gauntlet," cried Shirley, with a bland and
broader smile than usual on his
face&mdash;"most unfortunate affair&mdash;the more so
as the enemy are coming rapidly on."
</p>

<p>
"But, sirrah, what in the world
tempted you to commit this act of folly?"
I demanded, furiously.
</p>

<p>
"My dear fellow&mdash;ah, ah! you should
remember the old saw&mdash;in this world
expect everything, and be astonished at
nothing.  I crave your pardon, as it is
not pleasant to have one's promotion
stopped, and be a prisoner of war.  'Twas
all a mistake&mdash;a deuced error in judgment,
as the Court said which shot Admiral
Byng.  But don't attempt to swim the
river," he exclaimed, on seeing that in my
fury I made my horse rear wildly up; "it
is too broad, too deep and rapid.
Surrender with a good grace&mdash;discretion is
the better part of valour.  Here come the
French Light Troops.  Zounds! and they
are firing, too!"
</p>

<p>
And with an ironical smile, which I
could see distinctly, he waved his hand
with a mock salute, and somewhat hastily
entered the tower of Freyenthal, for a few
scattered files of the Volontaires de
Clermont, when they came up, opened a fire
upon our men, who, in bewilderment at
the whole affair, were loitering at the other
end of the ruined bridge.
</p>

<p>
"I have swam baith Esk and Liddle in
full flood, and damn me if I won't swim
this!" exclaimed Hob Elliot, who was
about to spur his horse madly into the
stream, when I caught his bridle.  And
thus, in less than five minutes, with my
ten troopers, I found myself disarmed,
dismounted, and marched off a prisoner of
war, in presence of Colonel Preston and
the remainder of the Light Troop, through
the cowardice or treachery&mdash;I knew not
which&mdash;of Shirley the aide-de-camp.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
LES VOLONTAIRES DE CLERMONT.
</h3>

<p>
My handsome grey trooper was bestrode
by a dapper little French sous-lieutenant,
who seemed to enjoy the ride amazingly,
all the more that I, a <i>sacré Anglais</i>, trudged
by his side in my boots, secured to the
stirrup-leather by a cord.
</p>

<p>
Fords on the river there were none near;
thus, as we were marched off, we knew
that all the courage of our comrades, and
the skill and energy of Colonel Preston,
could avail us nothing.  Of all my party
I was the most depressed; but big Hob
Elliot was the most vituperative, and swore
at our bad luck and at our captors, in
terms which fortunately they did not
understand.
</p>

<p>
"The devil!" he muttered; "if they
discover 'twas I who encountered their
favourite Prince Xavier, and gave him that
Lockerbie lick in front of the 51st, they
will shoot me off hand like a hoodiecrow."
</p>

<p>
"Unless we tell them, they can never
know; and if they did, your fears are
unnecessary, Hob.  The French are too brave
to resent what was done in fair fight."
</p>

<p>
"Gude wot, I did all I could to spare
the puir body.  My father, who was a
smith at Cannobie, in Liddesdale, used to
say that 'mony a stout trooper has been
lost for lack of a nail;' but, by the horns
o' auld Clootie, here are ten of us and a
cornet lost for lack of a little prudence."
</p>

<p>
"Prudence&mdash;a nail&mdash;what the devil are
you talking about, Hob?" said I, angrily.
</p>

<p>
"Weel, sir, for lack of a nail the shoe
was lost, and for lack of the shoe the
horse; and for want of his horse the
trooper came to grief, being overtaken in
his boots and slain by the enemy.  And all
this came aboot by the lack of a nail in
his horse's shoe&mdash;sae quoth my faither the
smith."
</p>

<p>
"And thus, Hob, if I understand your
parable, you think that for lack of a little
prudence you have all lost your liberty,
and I my promotion and liberty for years
to come?"
</p>

<p>
"Just so.  Had we gone threes about at
the time I ventured to hint it, we would
have been on the other side of the river
wi' auld Geordie Preston just now.  But
as for years, sir, dinna speak o' years," he
exclaimed, clenching a huge bony hand
that must often have swung the great
hammer in his father's forge, and at the
village games: "there is not a prison in
a' France, e'en the <i>Basteel</i> itsel', that
will haud Hob Elliot gin he wants to
win oot."
</p>

<p>
My anger at Shirley was deep&mdash;too deep
for me to express to my companions in
misfortune.  I remembered how he had
withheld the letter of Aurora, from the
time we were quartered in Alphen, until
the morning of Minden; how, on this
very day, he had smilingly warned me
to remember that the bridge of Freyenthal
was undermined; how I had seen him
gesticulating with our unwilling men, and
had witnessed their most evident hesitation
ere he snatched the match from one and
sprung the mine!
</p>

<p>
I saw more clearly than ever that he
loved my cousin; that he viewed, or
thought he viewed in me a rival, and
believed that he had now fully provided
for me for some time at least, if not for
ever, as few could tell what might be the
dangers and contingencies of a military
imprisonment in France.
</p>

<p>
Then occurred an idea under which I
writhed anew.  That after enduring
perhaps years of captivity&mdash;years during
which my comrades of the Greys would
be playing the great game of war and
glory&mdash;years that would see my brother
subalterns all captains and field-officers,
I might be transmitted with others home
to find myself a cornet still, and a penniless
one too, while, probably, Shirley the
poltroon, who had worked me as much
evil (just as his brother had done poor
Charters) might be the husband of Aurora,
and the proprietor of my patrimony&mdash;of
Netherwood, its hall and fields, wood and
wold!
</p>

<p>
With this chain of thought burning
within me I turned fiercely and looked
back to the old tower of Freyenthal.
Across the snow-clad landscape it was
distinctly visible, with a group of
redcoats near it; but I was not permitted
to loiter, as a tug of the cord which
secured me to my horse warned me that
the rider was impatient, and compelled me
to trudge on.
</p>

<p>
We soon reached the train of waggons
which were halted in the ravine, and
amid the cracking of whips, and much
noisy congratulation and laughter, the
escort of the Volontaires de Clermont
resumed their route, we knew not and
cared not whither.
</p>

<p>
Among the officers who accompanied
this party I observed one, a fair-haired
young man, of very prepossessing aspect,
who checked his horse for a moment, and
regarded me attentively.
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur l'officier," said he, lifting
his hat, "we have surely had the pleasure
of meeting before?"
</p>

<p>
"You were one of those who came with
the flag of truce to Minden," said I,
responding to his salute.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly, monsieur&mdash;for the body of
Prince Xavier&mdash;ah, diable! a sad business
that was" (at the prince's name Hob
Elliot looked about him as if preparing
to fight or flee).  "I am M. Monjoy, of
the French Engineer department."
</p>

<p>
I bowed, on which he again uncovered
his head, with that genuine politeness and
grace which were so charming in the
French officers of the old school.
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur le lieutenant," said he,
turning sharply to the dapper little
subaltern who had assumed a right of
property in my person, and saying
something&mdash;I know not what&mdash;rapidly in
French.  On this, the cord which secured
me to the stirrup-leather of my own
saddle was undone, and I was permitted
to march at my ease; but the horse
itself my captor resolutely refused to
give up.
</p>

<p>
I found the young engineer Monjoy a
very pleasant companion.  He was grave,
earnest, and rational&mdash;quite unlike
Boisguiller and many other French officers
whom I had met.  He held out hopes
that I should soon be exchanged (so
much the worse for <i>you</i>, Major Shirley,
thought I), as we had so many of King
Louis' officers in our hands, among the
5000 prisoners taken in the town of
Minden.  He said many other cheering
things, and insisted on sharing with me
the contents of his haversack (German
sausage and biscuits) and of his canteen;
and I remained by his side, during a
long, slow, and bitterly cold day's march,
which brought us to the little town of
Ysembourg, whose prince had been slain
at the battle of Minden.
</p>

<p>
His castle, a famous old fortress, crowns
the summit of a hill near Corbach.  The
French standard was flying on it, and
there, next morning, we were conducted
with several other prisoners, chiefly Black
Hussars of the Prussian army, under an
escort of the Volontaires de Clermont.
</p>

<p>
The morning was chilly and depressing;
a dense frosty mist covered all the ground;
we were without cloaks, without breakfast,
cold and miserable; and gloomily we
looked at each other as we trod up the
snow-clad hill, passing several ancient
iron-mines, till we neared the gate of the
castle, at which stood two sentinels of
the Regiment de Bretagne, muffled in
their greatcoats, all whitened by the
frost-rime, which seemed to have edged
their three-cocked hats as with silver
lace.
</p>

<p>
While we were ascending, one of our
escort suddenly perceived a ring on my
right hand.  It was the emerald given to
me by Jacqueline on that morning when
first we met&mdash;when I had saved her life
near St. Malo; and now the rascal
demanded it at once and most peremptorily too.
</p>

<p>
I declined to comply, on which, with
great deliberation, he cocked his piece,
drew his thumb-nail across the edge of
the flint, to ensure its not missing fire,
and deliberately placed the muzzle to my
head.  Whether or not the fellow would
have dared to shoot an officer who was
a prisoner of war, I cannot say, but on
finding myself so vehemently pressed I
drew off the ring, which he at once
clutched, and put in his haversack, with
a laugh and an oath, little foreseeing how
dear the bauble was to cost him.
</p>

<p>
At that moment a blow from behind
stretched him on the earth.  It was dealt
by the clenched hand of Hob Elliot, who,
poor fellow, ran imminent danger, for a
dozen of fixed bayonets were directly
levelled at him breast high, and he would
have been instantly immolated, had not
an officer of rank, accompanied by
M. Gervais Monjoy, rushed forward from the
castle-gate, by their influence and
authority to stop the brawl.
</p>

<p>
In the officer I recognised the count
who had come with Monjoy for Prince
Xavier's body, and who had been so
deeply moved on beholding his remains
exhumed on the field.
</p>

<p>
To him I was about to prefer a complaint
of the robbery, when he hurriedly
turned away, having other matters to
attend to, and I was left with the
plunderer, who had divined my intention, and
tapping the butt of his firelock, gave me
a threatening grimace, so much as to say,
"Beware!"
</p>

<p>
Soon after this I was conducted into an
ante-room, and thus separated from the
rest of the prisoners, who were marched
into the interior of the castle.
</p>

<p>
As the ten men of the Greys left me,
each came forward in succession and
saluted me as I shook hands with them
all, and some said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"God bless you, sir; I hope we shall
soon meet again."
</p>

<p>
A hope&mdash;save in one instance&mdash;never
realized by these worthy fellows, as nine
of them died in French prisons, I know
not where or how&mdash;probably at Bitsche
or Verdun.
</p>

<p>
The room in which I found myself
appeared to be a kind of ante-chamber.
Its windows were barred, and a sentinel
with his bayonet fixed paced to and fro
monotonously outside.  Within were tables
littered with letters, order-books, and
several orderlies with canes and
sidearms were loitering about on forms and
benches.
</p>

<p>
"Who commands here?" I inquired of one.
</p>

<p>
"Monseigneur le Duc de Broglie,"
replied the soldier, with a polite bow; "this
château of the prince of Ysembourg is
his head-quarters, and in a few minutes
monsieur will have the honour of being
brought before him."
</p>

<p>
At that moment I heard a voice at
some distance say, with a tone of authority,
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur le Comte de Bourgneuf,
<i>bring in your prisoner</i>."
</p>

<p>
At this unpleasant conjunction of
names I felt my heart beat quick, and
then I saw the colonel of the Regiment
de Bretagne, the stern-looking bearer of
the flag of truce, beckoning me follow
him.
</p>

<p>
I did so, and in another moment found
myself in the presence of the famous
Maréchal Duc de Broglie&mdash;the father of
Jacqueline!
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap07"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
THE DUC DE BROGLIE.
</h3>

<p>
There was one other present whom I
could very well have spared&mdash;the Count
de Bourgneuf&mdash;the stern young colonel,
who eyed me steadily with a glance of a
very mingled cast&mdash;at least, I thought
so, for he was the husband of Jacqueline
de Broglie.
</p>

<p>
The Duke, her father, a venerable and
stately soldier, who wore the uniform of
a maréchal of France, but of a fashion
somewhat old, and who had his hair
profusely powdered, received me with a polite
salute.
</p>

<p>
The room in which we met was a
vaulted chamber of the old castle.  In a
corner thereof stood a <i>cornette</i>, a standard
peculiar to the French Light Cavalry, and
from its pole there still hung the white
silk scarf which was usually tied to these
cornettes when the dragoons went into
action, to render them conspicuous, so
that they might be rallied round it; and
this scarf had doubtless been there since
the duke's own regiment had fled at a
gallop from Minden.  In a corner were
embroidered the initials "J. de B."  Had
Jacqueline's fair fingers worked that scarf
and standard?  In another corner stood
a pair of kettledrums and a few muskets.
</p>

<p>
A table, whereon lay some maps of
Germany by Herman Moll, several French
newspapers&mdash;particularly the <i>Mercure</i>&mdash;the
<i>Gazette de Bruxelles</i>; bundles of
dispatches and writing materials stood near
the arched Gothic fireplace.  A few
antique chairs were round it, and on these
were seated two or three field-officers of
the Regiment de Bretagne, Monjoy, the
engineer, and the Comte de Bourgneuf,
all in full uniform, powdered and
aiguiletted, with their swords, sashes, and
orders on.
</p>

<p>
All these details I saw at a glance, and
again my eyes rested on the benign face
of the old Duc de Broglie, in whom,
however, I failed to trace any resemblance
to his daughter.
</p>

<p>
At the door of the room stood a
sentinel of the Volontaires de Clermont,
with his musket "ordered" and bayonet
fixed&mdash;the same fellow who had so
violently possessed himself of my emerald
ring.
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur le prisonnier is an officer?"
said the Duke, bowing again.
</p>

<p>
"I have the honour," said I, while
Bourgneuf eyed me superciliously through
his eyeglass.
</p>

<p>
"In the British service, as I see by
your uniform."
</p>

<p>
"The <i>Ecossais Gris</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Bien!" said the Duke, smiling; "I
remember some of them.  Your rank?"
</p>

<p>
"Cornet."
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;it is unfortunate to be taken
thus, with a rank so junior; an old fellow
like me might wish for a rest; but you&mdash;ah
monsieur! you may be long a prisoner
if this war continues."
</p>

<p>
My heart sank at this remark, but I said,
</p>

<p>
"I am not without hope of effecting an
exchange."
</p>

<p>
"You were taken prisoner at the bridge
of the Lahn?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, monseigneur."
</p>

<p>
"Your people blew it up, M. Monjoy
says.  How was it that they did so
without permitting you to repass it?"
</p>

<p>
"I know not, monseigneur," said I,
for I would not own in that place that a
British officer would act so basely as
Shirley had done.  The Duke repeated
his question, but I simply bowed with
the same answer.
</p>

<p>
"What forces are there?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Only the Light Troop of my regiment&mdash;the
2nd Dragoons, or <i>Ecossais Gris</i>."
</p>

<p>
"The rest of the Regiment?"
</p>

<p>
"Are cantoned further down the river."
</p>

<p>
"Your strength, monsieur?" continued
the Duke, glancing at a paper on the
table.
</p>

<p>
"Six troops."
</p>

<p>
"That we know," said Count Bourgneuf,
brusquely, "there is a troop of your
Scottish Grey Horse in each of the six
villages along the Lahn; but what is their
numerical strength?"
</p>

<p>
"I have had no means of knowing since
our rapid <i>pursuit</i> at Minden," said I, with
reserve.
</p>

<p>
De Bourgneuf eyed me fiercely through
his glass; but the Duke smiled, and asked,
</p>

<p>
"Where are the other regiments of
milord Granby's Cavalry division?"
</p>

<p>
"I beg to be excused giving such
information," replied I.
</p>

<p>
"Then, monsieur," said the Duke,
suavely, "have you any idea of when
Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick proposes
to break up from winter quarters and take
the field?"
</p>

<p>
"Happily I have no means of knowing&mdash;being
merely a subaltern officer; but,"
added I, haughtily, "if I <i>did</i> know, most
assuredly I should decline informing the
General of the enemy!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Très bien</i>&mdash;of course," said the old
Duke, shrugging his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Beware, sir!" said the Comte de
Bourgneuf, with a dark frown on his
stern visage; "you would not tell, even
if you knew, say you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, by Heaven!" said I, loftily.
</p>

<p>
"Monseigneur le Duc, have I your permission
to summon a file of the guard with
a piece of cord?  <i>Ha, coquin!</i>" he added,
imperiously turning to me, "I have ere
now forced a more unwilling tongue to
speak, by tying a cord round a prisoner's
head, and wrenching it with my pistol-barrel
or sword-hilt till half the scalp came
off.  And this I did in a district named
the Morbihan, a part of France with which
you once affected to be familiar."
</p>

<p>
This remark, and the keen, feverish
glance which accompanied it, showed me
at once that I stood on perilous ground.
</p>

<p>
"M. le Comte," exclaimed Monjoy,
"bethink you of what you say and do.
Monsieur is a prisoner of war.  <i>Ma
foi!</i> this will never pass."
</p>

<p>
"When I have been robbed by a French
soldier under arms I need not be surprised
by this display of ruffianism in one of his
officers," said I, calmly, but while my
heart swelled with anger and apprehension.
The Count started to his feet; but the
Duke raised his hand and voice authoritatively:
</p>

<p>
"Halt, Bourgneuf.  In this matter your
zeal goes beyond my wishes.  But how
say you, monsieur?" he added, turning
sharply to me; "you speak of being
robbed.  Who has robbed you?"
</p>

<p>
"Men of the regiment of Count de
Clermont, deprived me of my cloak, of my
haversack&mdash;there was little in it, save
three days' half-rations; of my
purse&mdash;there was little in it, so they were
welcome to that too; but this man, who is
now sentinel at your door, with the
muzzle of his cocked musket at my head,
like a common footpad or cutpurse,
robbed me of a valuable ring, on which,
for the memory of past days, I set a
singular value."
</p>

<p>
Such was my dread of M. de Bourgneuf,
that circumstanced as I then was I dared
not tell when, or where, or for what service
I had received the ring.
</p>

<p>
"Is this true, fellow?" demanded the
Duke, turning sternly to the sentinel, who
was too terrified to reply either in the
affirmative or the negative.
</p>

<p>
"You will find it in his haversack,"
said I.
</p>

<p>
De Bourgneuf, without ceremony,
plunged his hand into the canvas bag
which was slung over the poor wretch's
right shoulder, and among his ration
biscuits, hair and shoe-brushes, &amp;c., drew
forth the ring, which he handed to the
Duke.  On beholding it the latter started
and visibly changed colour.
</p>

<p>
"Is this your ring, monsieur?" he
asked, while surveying me and it
alternately.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, monseigneur."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" he exclaimed, with
growing perplexity; "this is most
singular&mdash;most marvellous!  Whence had
you this ring? for on my honour as peer
and maréchal of France, it belonged to my
dead wife and was my parting gift to my
dear daughter when I left Paris to
command the army in Germany."
</p>

<p>
"I got it, monseigneur, while serving
with the first expedition to Brittany,"
said I, evasively, and to gather time for
thought, as the sharp glittering eyes of
Bourgneuf were fixed on me with stern
scrutiny.
</p>

<p>
"May I inquire from whom?"
</p>

<p>
"From Mademoiselle Jacqueline De
Broglie on the morning when I saved her
life from a galley-slave, a felon escaped
from St. Malo, named Theophile Hautois,
whom I afterwards flung into the Black
Torrent at St. Aubin du Cormier."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" exclaimed the Duke.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Tres bon!</i>  Marvellous!" added
Monjoy, and all present save Bourgneuf,
who muttered audibly the offensive
epithet, "<i>Marmiton!</i>"
</p>

<p>
"I have heard of some of those things,"
said the Duke, extending his hands to me,
"and so I pray you to keep the ring and
accept my sincere gratitude for your brave
protection of my child.  Comte Guillaume
De Boisguiller, our kinsman, who
commands at St. Malo, has told me of those
passages.  Bourgneuf, have you nothing
to say to the protector of Jacqueline&mdash;of
your wife?"
</p>

<p>
The Count had heard, perhaps, more
than I wished, for he merely made a
French grimace, and presented two fingers
of his hand, and then turned on his heel.
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur le prisonnier," said the Duke,
"you shall dine with me to-day.
To-morrow you shall be sent across the Lahn
to your regiment free, and you will have
no reason to forget your interview with
one so old in harness as the Maréchal De
Broglie; but meanwhile you shall see
how we in France punish the soldier who
dishonours his colours, and degrades
himself by acts of plunder.  Count, make that
sentinel a prisoner; assemble a drumhead
court-martial, and desire the drummers of
the Volontaires de Clermont to beat to
arms."
</p>

<p>
The Count retired.  A great bustle
reigned for a time in the old castle of
Ysembourg.  The man who had plundered
me was taken into a room adjoining that
in which the Duke continued to write his
letters and orders, and to take a pinch of
rappee from time to time while conversing
most affably with me; and I could glean
that Madame De Bourgneuf had never
informed him of my enacting the part of
her niece's soubrette.  How the Count
knew of it was more than I could learn;
but his grim hint about "the Morbihan"
sufficed to show that he knew all.  The
Duke studiously abstained from all
reference to military matters, save a few
remarks about the new and then famous
Prussian discipline and manoeuvres.  I
listened to the old man with pleasure, and
looked forward with joy and impatience to
my rejoining the Greys, and to the punishment
I meant to inflict upon Major Shirley.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile I heard the tread of feet,
the clatter of accoutrements, and loud
words of command uttered where the
Volontaires de Clermont were parading in
open column of companies on the plateau
before the gate.  The trial was soon over,
as the sentence had been resolved on even
before the drumhead court&mdash;a mere
formality&mdash;had assembled.  The battalion
formed a hollow square, and then the
Duke led me to a window from whence I
could see the whole parade and ceremony.
</p>

<p>
A sergeant of the company, to which
the culprit belonged, led him into the
centre in heavy marching order, and fully
accoutred, but having his arms tied with
a rope.  The brief proceedings of the
court and its sentence were read by the
adjutant, and then the sergeant said in a
loud voice,
</p>

<p>
"Finding thee, Silvain de Pricorbin,
unworthy to bear arms, we thus degrade and
render thee incapable of carrying them."
</p>

<p>
He then took the musket from his
shoulder backwards, cut away his
epaulettes and knapsack, drew off his
cross-belts, sword and bayonet, and giving him
a most deliberate kick upon the hinder
part of his person, repeated,
</p>

<p>
"Te trouvant indigne de porter les
armes, nous t'en dégradons.  So thus art
thou, Silvain de Pricorbin, degraded&mdash;begone!"
</p>

<p>
The sergeant then withdrew, on which
the provost marshal advanced and laid his
hand upon the poor pale wretch, whom, to
my dismay, I saw hanged upon a tree
about fifty yards from the gates, and in
presence, it would seem, of a brother.
</p>

<p>
The drums beat a ruffle; all was over,
and the Volontaires de Clermont were
dismissed to resume their games of piquet,
trictrac, or dominoes, and to smoke and
joke in the frosty sunshine, as if nothing
so terrible had occurred; and so ended the
first episode of my compulsory visit to the
old castle of Ysembourg.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
AN OLD FRIEND ARRIVES.
</h3>

<p>
According to his invitation, I dined with
the brave Duc de Broglie, in the hall of
the old Schloss, the walls and roof of
which still bore all the frescoes, heraldic
devices and ornaments with which Count
Josias had decorated it many years before.
Bourgneuf declined to be present, and I
cannot say that I regretted his absence;
but we had M. Monjoy and some officers
of the Regiments of Clermont and
Bretagne, all pleasant, gay and affable men
save the engineer, who was somewhat
reserved, even sad in manner.
</p>

<p>
The Duke talked freely of the folly and
loss of life occasioned by our unmeaning
expeditions to the coast of France, and
dilated particularly on the third (a service
which the Greys escaped, by receiving the
route for Germany), which ended in
the unfortunate battle of St. Cas, where
General Durie, Sir John Armitage, and
one thousand of our finest troops,
particularly of the 1st Foot Guards, were
slaughtered on the beach, while four hundred
were drowned in their disastrous flight.
</p>

<p>
Minden, however, he and those present
tacitly ignored; the defeat there was too
recent to be a pleasant French souvenir.
</p>

<p>
He spoke frequently and always with
praise of my regiment, the <i>Ecossais Gris</i>,
which he knew well, having often
encountered them on service.  He knew Colonel
Preston too, and laughed at his quaint
old buff coat.  He had met the corps at
Dettingen, and acknowledged that it was
from <i>his</i> hand that one of the Greys
wrenched away the famous White
Standard&mdash;the Cornette Blanche&mdash;of the
Gendarmes du Roi, and he perfectly
remembered the retort, recorded in our
first volume as having been made by
Colonel Preston to Louis Philippe Duc
d'Orleans, at the review of the Scots Greys
in Hyde Park.
</p>

<p>
"A greater dishonour than the loss of
that banner was never suffered by the
Household Cavalry of France," continued
the Duc de Broglie; "the <i>Cornette
Blanche</i> is a royal standard, which was
substituted for the ancient <i>Pennon Royal</i>,
and was never unfurled save when the
King in person led the army; those who
served immediately under it were the
princes, nobles, and maréchals of France,
with old field-officers who received orders
from his Majesty direct; so, messieurs,
you may imagine what I felt on finding
myself unhorsed, and seeing it borne
through the slaughter in the hands of a
Scottish Grey trooper!"
</p>

<p>
Amid all the topics which we discussed
over the wine of the defunct Prince of
Ysembourg, with the contents of whose
cellars, hewn deep in the old castle rock,
Monseigneur le Duc and his epauletted
and aiguiletted staff made most free, I
could glean nothing about Jacqueline,
where she resided, how she had married
her cousin, the stern Count, or why, or
wherefore; nor did I venture to ask&mdash;a
natural delicacy, with a difficulty of
approaching the subject, together with
something of pique, restrained me.
</p>

<p>
When I looked on the old Duc de
Broglie, dispensing the honours of his
table with an air so courtly in his
powdered hair, with his star and ribbon of
St. Louis, and when I thought of the
passionate love I had borne his daughter,
and how she had responded to it&mdash;how I
had sorrowed for her supposed death, and
so terribly avenged it&mdash;of all that had
been and never could be again,&mdash;I asked
of myself, were not all those days we had
spent together at that quaint château in
Brittany, amid its arbours trained by old
Urbain, its rose-gardens and leafy
labyrinth, a dream, or was I dreaming now?
</p>

<p>
That she should be the wife of this
Count de Bourgneuf&mdash;a Frenchman all
the more jealous because his mother was
a Spanish lady of Alava&mdash;who knew
more than I wished him to know about
those love passages in Brittany, and thus
hated me accordingly, seemed strange and
difficult to realize; but of that hate I had
good proof ere long.
</p>

<p>
Dinner was nearly over when the Chevalier
de Boisguiller, of the Hussars <i>de la
Reine</i>, was announced, and this gay
fellow, all travel-stained and with his face
looking very red, after a long ride against
a keen, frosty wind, entered with his
sabre under his left arm, and carrying his
fur cap with plume and scarlet kalpeck,
in his right hand.
</p>

<p>
"Welcome, kinsman Guillaume," said
the host, rising and presenting his hand;
"what news bring you from the
head-quarters of M. de Contades?"
</p>

<p>
"This despatch, monseigneur," replied
the hussar, delivering an oblong letter
sealed with yellow wax, and making a
profound salute.
</p>

<p>
"When did you leave?"
</p>

<p>
"This morning, monseigneur."
</p>

<p>
"Ma foi! you must have come at a
good pace to reach Ysembourg by this
time."
</p>

<p>
"I dined early at Helingenstadt, and
when I have dined well and drunk good
wine, somehow my horse always goes
well.  The wine communicates itself
through the spur-rowels, I think.  'Tis
sixty miles and more from Helingenstadt
to this, so as the sight of these viands
makes me hungry again, I shall join you
gentlemen.  Thus hunger, a long ride
over a snow-covered country&mdash;snow&mdash;<i>ouf!</i> it
is six feet deep at Hesse Cassel&mdash;with
a young appetite, are capital sauce to
a meal, and if your cook equals your
maitre d'hôtel, my dear maréchal&mdash;<i>Grands
Dieux!</i> what have we here?&mdash;a
ragout&mdash;delightful!&mdash;gigot de mouton, with
force-meat balls, like grape and
canister shot.  Monjoy, I shall trouble
you for a slice.  <i>Parbleu!</i> my friends,
where did you pick up all these
dainties?  I thought those active
devils, the Black Hussars of His
Prussian Majesty, had swept everything
but snow and icicles out of Hesse and
Westphalia.  Monjoy, <i>mon cher</i>, what
does that silver jug contain?"
</p>

<p>
"Champagne-punch, chevalier."
</p>

<p>
"Made how?"
</p>

<p>
"One bottle of claret to three of champagne,
with some sugar, a little hot water,
a squeeze or so of a lemon, and after a
few glasses&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"One may see all the sentinels and
outposts double their <i>usual</i> number, and
the main body quite what M. le Maréchal
wishes it to be, before beating up the
quarters of Prince Ferdinand, <i>mon brave</i>;
hand it over here!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Pardieu!</i>" he exclaimed, setting
down the silver jug after a long draught,
"what do I see&mdash;Monsieur Gauntlet of
the Grey Scots&mdash;a prisoner, eh?  In the
dusk I took you in your red coat for a
mousquetaire rouge."
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur is a prisoner, who, for the
service he has done my family, returns
free to the allied lines to-morrow," said
the Duke, who had been rapidly
skimming the despatch, while Boisguiller
had been keeping up a running fire of
small talk.  "I must leave you, messieurs;
Monjoy will take my place at the head of
the table, as this despatch requires
immediate attention.  Contades returns to
France for a time; the entire command is
vested in me, and the army is to be
augmented to a hundred thousand men,
while thirty thousand more are to be
formed upon the Rhine, under the orders
of the Comte St. Germain.  My brother's
regiment of Cuirassiers must ride towards
Wetzler, as the King of Prussia's
Death's-head Hussars are marching in
that direction.  We move from this
early&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Loud cries of "Bravo&mdash;Vive le Roi!
Vive le Maréchal Duc!" rang round the
table.
</p>

<p>
"And the castles of Marburg and
Dillenburg may soon have some powder
burnt before them.  You see, M. Gauntlet,
I have no secrets from you, though you
were so reserved with me this morning.
Adieu, messieurs&mdash;make yourselves at
home; I am an old campaigner, but must
keep my head clear for the work of the
bureau."
</p>

<p>
And with a smiling bow the stately
old Maréchal left us.  Then around the
table the conversation became more
gay, free, and unrestrained; the
wine-decanters were circulated with a
rapidity that loosened every tongue, and as
usual with Frenchmen, they all talked at
once without listening much to each
other.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
MONJOY.
</h3>

<p>
When most of the officers had
withdrawn, Monjoy drew close to me and
said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"There is more in the Maréchal's
dispatch than met our ears&mdash;matters not
pleasant to the pride of de Broglie."
</p>

<p>
"How?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"You must know, monsieur, that since
the time that Prince Ferdinand possessed
himself of the castle of Marburg, and
indeed ever since Minden, Maréchal de
Contades has been very unpopular with
our troops.  He charged the Duc de
Broglie with misconduct.  The Duc
recriminated, and gained credit with the
Court at Versailles, when a victim was
required to satisfy popular clamour.  That
victim was M. de Contades, so our camp,
like your own, in the case of milord
Sackville, has not been without
dissensions.  But permit me to inquire, did
you ever meet the Comte de Bourgneuf
before that day when we came for the
body of Prince Xavier of Saxony?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;but why do you ask?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Parbleu!</i>&mdash;'tis strange! and you never
did him any wrong?" continued Monjoy,
earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"Wrong&mdash;I know of none; but wherefore
these inquiries?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Because during the execution of that
Volontaire de Clermont&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The poor wretch who appropriated my ring?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;well, I overheard him swear,
a low voice, to Armand de Pricorbin, who
accompanied his brother Silvain to the
gallows, that you should never reach the
allied lines alive, and the man gave him a
fierce and rapid glance, as much as to say,
we understand each other.  I was not
supposed to observe, or to overhear all
this, and could neither control nor take the
Count, my superior officer, to task for it."
</p>

<p>
"But I shall&mdash;he is not my superior
officer.  I thank you, M. Monjoy, and
shall challenge him for this," said I,
wrathfully.
</p>

<p>
"You would be extremely rash, and if
a duel ensued the Duc de Broglie would
severely punish the survivor, especially
one in your circumstances."
</p>

<p>
"Then what is to be done, for at this
moment a plot for my assassination may
be forming?"
</p>

<p>
"Return as quickly as possible to the
other side of the Lahn," said Boisguiller,
who had listened in silence to the
foregoing.  "I know more of this matter than
you, Monjoy, and while disapproving of
the sentiments of my kinsman, de Bourgneuf,
am most anxious to serve M. Gauntlet,
as an old friend who saved and
served me when in a desperate and
degrading position.  <i>Grands Dieux</i>!  I am
not likely to forget that prison-ship, the
<i>Alceste</i>, for some time to come!"
</p>

<p>
For a minute or more, I remained in
doubt what to do.  My first idea
suggested a report of the affair to the Duc
de Broglie; but that would avail me little
unless he gave me an armed escort, to
apply for which would argue either guilt
or timidity.  To take the count bluntly
and boldly to task would be, my friends
averred, perilous work; and to seek an
interview with Jacqueline, his countess,
and beg <i>her</i> advice in the matter&mdash;even if
I knew where she resided&mdash;was a measure
more perilous still, and one to be dreaded.
</p>

<p>
"You really think that Bourgneuf is
capable of having me waylaid and cut
off?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Quite," replied Monjoy; "excuse me
talking thus of your kinsman, Boisguiller;
but his mother was an Espagnole of Alava,
and we all know the spirit he is likely to
inherit.  My advice to you is, monsieur,
immediately on receiving the signed passport
of the Duc de Broglie, to set out ostensibly
for Hesse Cassel&mdash;observe this map; it is
about seven leagues from here, according
to Herman Mall.  But go not there;
strike off towards Frankenburg, and push
on for the Lahn, while Bourgneuf and
his people may be searching for you in
the direction of the Weser."
</p>

<p>
"And pray start to-night, and <i>bon voyage</i>,
<i>mon ami!</i>" said Boisguiller, draining his
glass.
</p>

<p>
"In my ignorance of the country and
the language&mdash;on foot, too&mdash;I shall never
reach the Lahn alone."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not, <i>mon camarade</i>, we never
meant you to do so," replied Monjoy.
"Boisguiller cannot accompany you, as he
returns to Helingenstadt to-morrow; but I
shall do so with pleasure, at least a few
leagues of the way, for to-morrow at noon,
I have to lay before the Duc de Broglie
plans of the castles of Marburg and
Dillenburg, with the intended approaches and
lines of circumvallation."
</p>

<p>
I was thanking this frank friend in
suitable terms, when a gold locket became
disengaged from the ribbon by which it
was suspended at his neck, and fell at my
feet.  When handing it across the table
to him, I could perceive that it contained
the miniature of a girl, young, lovely, and
fairhaired.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Morbleu!</i> Gervais Monjoy," exclaimed
Boisguiller; "is it thus, my fine fellow,
that you treasure the image of Madame
d'Escombas?"
</p>

<p>
"Madame! is this girl, a child almost,
married?" said I, perhaps imprudently.
</p>

<p>
"Hush, gentlemen&mdash;hush, for God's
sake and for hers&mdash;upon your honour,
hush!" said Monjoy, in a husky voice, as
he replaced the locket in his breast, and
his cheek grew very pale.
</p>

<p>
"I know your sad story, and hers too,"
said the chevalier in a whisper; "but are
you wise to carry this trinket about with
you?"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis all of her that evil fate has left
me!" sighed Monjoy, filling his glass with
wine.
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but suppose you were killed in
action, and this portrait was found upon
you?"
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"Would it not compromise the honour
of madame?"
</p>

<p>
"With none who knew our wretched
history," replied Monjoy, in a broken
voice, and with a tremulous manner; "but
let us return to the affair of our friend."
</p>

<p>
"The Duc de Broglie knows not all
the <i>on dits</i> of Paris and Versailles," said
the chevalier, with an air of annoyance.
</p>

<p>
"The old man thinks only of brigades and
squadrons, of advances and retreats, and of
pontoon-bridges on the Rhine and Weser;
but&mdash;a word in your ear, M. Gauntlet:
if he knew all that was reported, you
might perhaps have not fared quite so
well in Ysembourg to-day."
</p>

<p>
"I do not comprehend," said I, coldly,
perhaps haughtily.
</p>

<p>
"Well, <i>mon ami</i>, it was reported in the
Chroniques Scandaleuses at Versailles and
Paris, that the young countess, then
Mademoiselle de Broglie, had a lover
disguised as her <i>soubrette</i>, and that the
fellow actually carried her off.  Thus
you see how rumour wove you and the
outlaw Hautois into one."
</p>

<p>
"Rumour might have added, that it
was revenue for Bourgneuf's abduction of
the sister Hautois of and the demolition
of his mother's cottage that made this man
the wretch we found him," said I,
bitterly "But oh!  Boisguiller," I added,
suddenly and passionately, as the fumes
of the wine mounted to my head; "you
know the truth and the falsehood of this
affair; you must know that I loved
Jacqueline purely and honourably, that I loved
her to despair, and how I sorrowed for
her supposed death!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ah, mon garçon</i>!  I cheated you nicely
at that old <i>chaumière</i> in the wood, and
all for the best, was it not?  But pray
don't give way to such outbursts here;
<i>ma foi!</i> no, they will never do; so be
wary and be off, ere worse come to pass.
Bourgneuf has some fellows in his
Regiment de Bretagne who would skin their
own fathers&mdash;people from his own estates
who would chop you into mincemeat if
such were his supreme will and pleasure,
and if quietly shooting you down did not
suit his purpose quite as well."
</p>

<p>
I took another glass of wine and
snapped my fingers, as a spirit of bravado
next possessed me.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, is the countess here?" I
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Madame de Bourgneuf, <i>née</i> Broglie?
well, she is not exactly at Ysembourg, but
we shall not say where.  Awkward, is it
not?" said the chevalier, playing with
the gold tassel of his hussar pelisse.
</p>

<p>
"Awkward!&mdash;what&mdash;how!" stammered I.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Diable!</i> without condescending to be
more plain, my friend, I think that under
all the circumstances, it <i>is</i> exceedingly
awkward that the countess, and you, a
former lover, are, with the knowledge of
such a man as Bourgneuf, within a few
miles of each other.  How do you feel
about it?"
</p>

<p>
"Simply, my dear chevalier," said I,
as the wax lights began to multiply
strangely, and the room seemed to swim
round me, "that my naturally fine
appetite is in no way impaired by the
circumstance, and I have dined as well as ever I
did on that deuced tough ration beef of
the Hessians; and as for Monsieur de
Bourgneuf&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He is at your service, monsieur!"
said a harsh voice in my car, while a hand
was laid, almost with a clutch, on my
right shoulder.  I turned and encountered
that which sobered me in a moment; the
stern and sallow face, and dark, glittering,
almond-shaped, and rather wicked eyes
of the Count de Bourgneuf, who had
entered unseen, and had overheard, <i>how much
or how little</i> of the past conversation, we
knew not.  He delivered to me a paper,
saying, "Monsieur, this is your signed
pass to the nearest British cantonment;
and you can depart when you please, and
by any route; so delay is unadvisable," he
added, with a keen glance.
</p>

<p>
"I thank you, Monsieur le Comte," said I.
</p>

<p>
"By the way of Hesse Cassel, I have
advised," said Monjoy hastily.
</p>

<p>
"The Lahn lies in an <i>opposite</i>
direction&mdash;but Hesse Cassel be it," said the Count,
with a deep smile.  "Ah, Boisguiller,
thou unconscionable tosspot&mdash;art bibbing
still?  Good evening, monsieur," he added
to me, as he bowed and withdrew; "a
pleasant and a <i>safe</i> journey to you."
</p>

<p>
"Did you remark his smile?" asked
Monjoy in a low voice, while twitching
my sleeve.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied I; "and it reminded
me of one who never smiled thus save
when planning mischief."
</p>

<p>
I thought of the aide-de-camp, Shirley.
</p>

<p>
"Boisguiller, assist me in getting a
horse for our comrade," said Monjoy,
looking at his watch: "it is now eight,
and we shall depart from this within an
hour."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap10"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
THE STORY OF MONJOY.
</h3>

<p>
It was long past midnight, however,
before we were prepared to leave
Ysembourg.  To set out with the conviction
that every tree, hedge, or thicket might
conceal at least one musket, the contents
of which were intended for my person,
was more exciting than pleasing.
</p>

<p>
The horse provided for me was one of
our grey troopers.  It had been wounded
by a pistol-ball at Minden, and halted on
the off hind leg, thus our progress was
slower than we could have wished.
</p>

<p>
As my purse had been taken by my
captors, Boisguiller gave me a couple of
louis d'ors, which sum I was to give in
turn to the first French officer whom we
took prisoner.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bon voyage!</i>" cried he, with a loud
voice, as we mounted at the arched
gateway of the old castle; "which way do
you ride?"
</p>

<p>
"Towards Hesse Cassel," replied Monjoy
in the same tone, intended specially
for the ears of those who loitered about;
and among them was Armand de Pricorbin,
who at once withdrew, and entered the
castle, no doubt to report our departure
to Bourgneuf.
</p>

<p>
"Hesse Cassel," continued Boisguiller;
"ah, I was quartered there for three
months before Minden, and added
considerably to the debts and general
discomfort of the citizens.  Adieu,
messieurs!"
</p>

<p>
"Adieu, M. le Chevalier!" and we
rode off.
</p>

<p>
Though considerably hardened by
campaigning and warfare&mdash;for had I not seen
Lindsay, Charters, Keith, and many others
who were dear friends and comrades
perish?&mdash;I shuddered on passing where
the corpse of Silvain de Pricorbin still
swung as a warning to pillagers, from the
arm of a tree above the pathway; there it
swayed mournfully to and fro in the
night wind, and I felt some remorse with
the conviction, that by an almost
heedless complaint, I had procured the death
of this man&mdash;and for what?  Abstracting
a ring&mdash;a bauble&mdash;the gift of a girl who
had discarded me for a man who
was now perhaps tracking me to destruction.
</p>

<p>
The stars shone brightly and keenly in
a calm sky as we rode down the hill from
Ysembourg, and saw a few lights twinkling
dimly in the little town of that
name.
</p>

<p>
By the foraging and skirmishing of the
light cavalry, the whole country between
the Maine and Lahn had been reduced to
a desert; and from Ysembourg to the
Weser it was pretty much the same, for,
according to their usual system, whatever
the French did not require they burned or
destroyed.
</p>

<p>
On our route I committed myself entirely
to the guidance of the intelligent
and friendly Monjoy&mdash;a pleasing young
man, whose bearing impressed me with
the decided conviction that <i>something</i> had
happened in his life, which, to him, cast
a shadow over the present and the
future.
</p>

<p>
"From what passed between you and
the Chevalier de Boisguiller," said he,
"am I right in supposing that a deadly
rivalry existed between you and
Bourgneuf prior to his marriage?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Monjoy; I repeat to you that I
never saw the Count until the day
subsequent to Minden, and I did not know him
even then, or until yesterday, when we
stood together in the presence of
Maréchal Broglie."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Parbleu!</i> 'tis most singular!"
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"How all this hostility on his part
came to pass."
</p>

<p>
"I shall tell you, and the narrative
may serve to shorten our journey."
</p>

<p>
I then related to him the whole story
of my adventures in Brittany; my love
for Jacqueline, and how strangely we were
thrown together in that sequestered
château; her abduction, and her supposed
death.  He seemed much struck by the
recital, and when I concluded he sighed
and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I, too, have not been fortunate in the
field of Cupid, and could tell you a story,
not so stirring as yours certainly, but
nevertheless full of most mournful
interest to me."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  I now remember the miniature
of that beautiful girl concerning whom
Boisguiller rallied and warned you."
</p>

<p>
"Boisguiller is thoughtless," replied the
young Frenchman, "but good-hearted and
brave; yet he is not the kind of man to
understand the depth of a passion such as
mine&mdash;a passion all the deeper because its
object is lost for ever!"
</p>

<p>
"Dead?"
</p>

<p>
"Worse, monsieur, she is married to
another, and this little locket is all I
possess to remind me of many happy, happy
days that can never come again.  I shall
be equally confiding with you, monsieur,
and will relate how I came to suffer so
deeply."
</p>

<p>
After a little pause, he began thus.
</p>

<p>
"My aunt is Prioress of the Convent of
Les Dames de Notre Dame de Charité, in
the Rue St. Jacques, at Paris, where they
occupy the ancient house of the Nuns of
the Visitation.  Her devotees observe the
general vows of the four monastic orders,
and occupy themselves with the education
of young ladies of good family, who are
boarded in the convent to acquire
accomplishments.
</p>

<p>
"When a mere youth attending school,
I used frequently to visit my aunt, and
spent all my holidays at her convent in
the Rue St. Jacques, and thus among the
boarders I first saw Isabelle du Platel,
who was placed there for her education.
She was just past girlhood; her family
were old Normans, and hence that
exquisite fairness of complexion and
golden-tinted hair which you remarked in her
miniature.
</p>

<p>
"We were always playmates and companions
in the convent garden; but after
a time this was interdicted by my aunt
the Prioress, who, foreseeing what might
happen, wisely exiled me from the
convent, and would only consent to receive
me in the parlour, and then on stated days
and certain occasions.
</p>

<p>
"I was in despair at this change in my
affairs; but a friend and brother student,
Boisguiller, then a sub-lieutenant in the
French Guards, enabled me to circumvent
to some degree the precautions of my
worthy relative, as he possessed an old
and unoccupied house in the Rue St. Jacques,
the windows of which overlooked
the convent garden; and thereat I spent
the hours that were not devoted to the
study of fortification, regular, irregular,
and defensive, of Coehorn, de Ville, and
Vauban, in watching for Isabelle, and
exchanging the most passionate little
billets by the simple process of lowering
them by a string from the windows, which,
fortunately perhaps, were too high up
and too strongly grated to permit nearer
meetings.
</p>

<p>
"For three years our love affair was
conducted thus, and we were happy in the
secrecy of our passion, which was all the
deeper that (Boisguiller excepted) others
knew it not, and could neither by jest or
taunt bring the ready blush to our young
cheeks; and so time passed, till Isabelle was
sixteen and I was three years her senior,
with an epaulette on my left shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"I can painfully recall the last day on
which I repaired to the accustomed place,
with a trinket I had brought for Isabelle,
and tying it to the cord, waited
impatiently, with my eyes fixed on the
flowery vista of the garden walk by which
she usually approached; but hour after
hour passed, and there came no Isabelle
to me!
</p>

<p>
"The next day and the next I met
with no better success, and a terror filled
my heart.  Had we been betrayed or
discovered?  Isabelle was ill&mdash;dying,
perhaps!  I rushed to the convent gate, and
sought an interview with my aunt.  The
old porteress had special orders to keep
me out; but my excitement was too much
for the good dame's nerves, and my
impetuosity swept all her scruples away.
Thus, she admitted me into the parlour and
when my aunt came&mdash;a woman tall, thin,
and stately in bearing, with a severe
expression on her brow that boded evil
fortune to me&mdash;I besought her to pardon
me, and to say if Mademoiselle du Platel
was ill!
</p>

<p>
"'I am most happy to inform you, my
dear Gervais, that she is not&mdash;but she has
left this&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
"'Left the convent,' I exclaimed; 'and
for where?'
</p>

<p>
"'Her father's house.'
</p>

<p>
"'In the Rue de Tournon?'
</p>

<p>
"'Near the palace of the Luxembourg&mdash;yes.'
</p>

<p>
"'And she will return?' I continued,
impetuously.
</p>

<p>
"'No more,' said my aunt, with a sad
smile.
</p>

<p>
"'No more?' I repeated, with perplexity.
</p>

<p>
"At least, not as Mademoiselle du
Platel.'
</p>

<p>
"'In heaven's name, madame&mdash;my dear
aunt, I conjure you to tell me what you
mean?  See how I am trembling!'
</p>

<p>
"'Compose yourself, my dear boy;
when next we see her, she will be
Madame d'Escombas.'
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, impossible&mdash;absurd!' I
exclaimed, with a perplexed heart and a
flushing cheek; 'do you mean old
M. d'Escombas, who also resides in the Rue
de Tournon, whose copper-coloured nose
is the laughing-stock of all Paris, and
whom I have caricatured, with his wig,
large buckles, and round shoulders, a
dozen of times?'
</p>

<p>
"'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
"'But that hideous old man has no
son to marry Isabelle?'
</p>

<p>
"'He is to marry her himself.'
</p>

<p>
"'Monstrous, madame!' I exclaimed,
furiously; 'how can this be?'
</p>

<p>
"'Because the father of Isabelle is poor,
and M. d'Escombas is rich enough to buy
the Luxembourg and all that is in it.
Such is the world, my poor Gervais, and
such are its ways and vanities!'
</p>

<p>
"Seeing that my eyes were full of tears,
she continued&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Gervais, listen to me, my dear boy.
M. du Platel, though he has been unable
to accumulate riches, for the acquisition
of which his desire is a passion very
strong, if not stronger than that of love
itself&mdash;has enough, but barely so, to
maintain a numerous family.  God has given
him a daughter lovely in the extreme&mdash;good,
amiable, and gentle too.  M. d'Escombas
is fired by her beauty: he is old
and coarse certainly; he has a nose covered
with rappee, cheeks that are rouged, and
false teeth; but then, he is <i>so</i> rich!  Ah,
<i>mon Dieu</i>, my dear boy, how you groan
and grind your teeth!'
</p>

<p>
"I had heard enough, and retired,
choking with resentment, indignation,
love, jealousy, and pity; and with all the
thoughts, fierce, bitter, and stinging, that
could madden a young and loving heart,
I found myself going I knew not, cared
not whither, jostling and staggering like
a blind man among the passers in the
sunlit Rue St. Jacques.  I was full of
vague plots and wild plans&mdash;full of
schemes of bitter vengeance, none of
which could take any tangible form, until
I met my friend Guillaume de Boisguiller,
who had just come off guard at the Louvre,
and who advised me to see Isabelle at
once&mdash;to run off with her.  But whither?
<i>Diable</i>!  I had no money&mdash;nothing but
my silver epaulette.  Then he suggested
that I should run d'Escombas through
the body.  That would be simple enough;
but I knew that a duel between an old
man and a mere boy was not to be
thought of, even in Paris, where all kinds
of absurdities are committed every hour;
and then he was a near kinsman of the
Governor of the Conciergerie du Palais,
and the very thought of that grim
personage, and his horrid place, made my
blood run cold."
</p>

<p>
(Poor gentle and amiable Monjoy!
while speaking to me how little did he
foresee that some of his last hours would
be spent in that degrading prison!)
</p>

<p>
"Taking a hint from the plot of a
comedy we had seen at the Théâtre
Français&mdash;then the only one in Paris in
which regular tragedies and comedies
could be acted, and which had an
exclusive right to represent the plays of
Corneille, Racine, Molière, and
Voltaire&mdash;Boisguiller borrowed the gown, hat, and
trinket-box of a Jew who was patronized
by the officers of his regiment, and by
adopting a false beard, a pair of horn
spectacles, and painting a few wrinkles
round his eyes, made his disguise
complete.  He then set out for the residence
of M. du Platel in the twilight of an
October evening.
</p>

<p>
"I was too nervous and too excited to
have done this in person; so Boisguiller,
whose coolness&mdash;impudence he was pleased
to term it&mdash;was invincible, became my
ambassador.
</p>

<p>
"He was not a chevalier then, not
having won his cross of St. Louis.  He
contrived to introduce himself to Isabelle,
and while she was looking over the
trinkets in his box, to whisper my name
in her ear, and to slip into her hand a
note from me, to which he begged an
answer ere he went away.
</p>

<p>
"'You are a friend of Gervais,' she
whispered; 'and in disguise?'
</p>

<p>
"His friend and companion&mdash;Boisguiller,
an officer of the French Guards.'
</p>

<p>
"'I thank you, monsieur, from my soul!
Oh, tell Gervais it is true about this
marriage&mdash;all too true, too true!  Despite
my love for him, a love of which I told
them in my agony, my parents sell me to
that odious and pitiless old man.  Sell
me,' she continued, while her blue eyes
sparkled with grief and anger, and her
soft cheek glowed with a feverish red,
'even as a Circassian girl is sold in a
Turkish bazaar!  I have been taken&mdash;torn
from my convent, and am kept here till
my purchaser arranges his household.
Oh, vile system!  How my soul revolts at
the life, the hopeless future, to which I
am doomed!'
</p>

<p>
"'And you will meet Gervais?'
</p>

<p>
"'But once, and then all is over, and
for ever!'
</p>

<p>
"'When&mdash;where will you meet him?'
urged my friend.
</p>

<p>
"'In the garden of the Luxembourg,
near the white marble lions, at noon
to-morrow; and failing that, on the next
day at the same hour.'
</p>

<p>
"Exulting in his diplomacy, Boisguiller
hurried back to me, relinquished
his disguise and resumed his uniform,
talking the while with noisy admiration
of the beauty and high spirit of
Mademoiselle du Platel.  Spirit? <i>mon
Dieu!</i> he little knew how, by all the appliances
of domestic and parental tyranny it had
been crushed and broken.
</p>

<p>
"With a soul inspired by tenderness
and anxiety, I repaired at the appointed
hour to the place of rendezvous&mdash;the
avenue to the garden nursery, containing
specimens of every kind of fruit then
cultivated in the provinces of France;
and there I leaned, so great was my
emotion, against the base of one of
the white marble lions, and my heart
fluttered at the sight of every female
figure.  But the clocks of Paris struck
the hour in vain; it passed away;
another hour succeeded, and there came
no Isabelle.
</p>

<p>
"Had they discovered our assignation,
those venal parents?  Was she ill&mdash;what
had happened?
</p>

<p>
"It was, however, merely a visit of
that provoking Monsieur d'Escombas
which interfered with her arrangements,
as he insisted on escorting her,
wherever she was going.  But next day,
when I sought the same place and
pressed her to my breast, we retired to
a secluded part of the garden, where
we could converse and freely deplore the
hard destiny which was about to separate
us for ever.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Grand Dieu</i>!  Monsieur Gauntlet, why
should I weary you with all this, and
what interest can it possibly have for
you?" exclaimed the Frenchman, suddenly
interrupting himself; but I pressed
him to continue, for the modulated tones
of his voice, a certain pathos in it, and
his sorrowful earnestness, gave his story
an interest which cannot be imparted to
it here.
</p>

<p>
"I implored Isabelle to elope with me;
but she trembled, closed her eyes, and
whispered, in a broken voice, that she
dared not.
</p>

<p>
"'You are but sixteen, Isabelle, and
they would consign you to a man of sixty&mdash;a
sweet young girl like you surrendered
to the cold arms of one whose heart is but
the dregs and lees of a life spent in
Paris!  Oh, it is piteous!'
</p>

<p>
"'And bitterly they taunt me&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
"'Who taunt you?'
</p>

<p>
"'My father and mother,' said she,
shuddering and closing her eyes, 'taunt
me with <i>you</i>, Gervais.  I ask for a husband
who will love me as I would wish to be
loved, and in reply they lay diamonds,
jewels, fans and feathers at my feet.
Away with these, I exclaimed, lest I
tread upon them!'
</p>

<p>
"And then the poor young girl wept
passionately&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'My beloved Isabelle,' I exclaimed,
'how shall I survive seeing you consigned
to a fate so miserable&mdash;to such a hopeless
life&mdash;to a lord and master whose age,
ideas, tastes, and ways are all so
unbearable and uncongenial?  Whose scorn and
cruelty&mdash;oh, I know him well&mdash;will
make you shrink as the frosty wind
withers the early flowers of spring, and
whose sordid coldness will crush your
little heart!  God preserve you, Isabelle,
from the fate of many others who are
similarly mated and lost in our worthy
city of Paris!'
</p>

<p>
"'I have to thank you for the character
you give of me, friend Monjoy, but 'twill
avail you little,' said a voice behind us,
and we found ourselves in the presence of
M. du Platel, and M. d'Escombas who had
just spoken, and also of his grim kinsman,
the governor of the Conciergerie du Palais.
</p>

<p>
"Fortunately the latter personage, of
whom I had&mdash;I know not why&mdash;an instinctive
horror, was present; for we were
in a solitary part of the garden.  I had my
sword on, and the malevolent smile on
the thick lips and coarse dark visage of
M. d'Escombas, with the furious scorn and
indignation of M. du Platel, might have
prompted me to commit some desperate
extravagance.
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, my father, my father!' implored
Isabelle; 'let me go back to my convent.
Mother St. Rosalie de Sicile assures
me that I have a true vocation!'
</p>

<p>
"'So it seems,' sneered M. d'Escombas,
'by your coming here to meet a young
spark three days before your marriage.'
</p>

<p>
"'Father, it is better to endure the
poverty, the vows, the life-long self-abnegation
of all in a convent, than an union
without love to a man who is older even
than thee.'
</p>

<p>
"Her voice was most touching&mdash;her
expression lovely; but the old barbarians
heard her unmoved.
</p>

<p>
"'Child, you know not what you say,'
replied M. de Platel, in great wrath.  'I
provide a rich marriage, a wealthy
husband, who will prove a kind one, too;
a splendid house here, close by the
Luxembourg; a life of freedom and gaiety; and,
<i>diable!</i> what more would you have? unless
it is this rascal of a student, who
would be better inside La Force than
here, creating mischief and dispeace.'
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, why torture me thus?' she
replied, faintly, while pressing her hands
on her heart.
</p>

<p>
"'Torture&mdash;<i>bon diable!</i> she talks of
torture, with a suitor here who has ever
so many thousand livres per annum,'
said M. du Platel, shrugging up his
shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"'<i>Mon père</i>,' she demanded, with her
little nostrils quivering, and her blue
eyes flashing fire; 'for how many
thousand purses do the Circassians sell?'
</p>

<p>
"'<i>Morbleu!</i> she is always speaking
about Circassians,' growled M. d'Escombas;
'what do we know of them, save
that they are pagans who eat horseflesh
on Friday, and never sign the cross or
keep the month of Mary.'
</p>

<p>
"'And yet they sell their daughters,
M. d'Escombas, just like the subjects of
the Most Christian king.'
</p>

<p>
"'Child, this is treason and blasphemy&mdash;and
close to the walls of the Luxembourg, too!'
</p>

<p>
"''Tis truth and despair.'
</p>

<p>
"'Summon a fiacre, M. d'Escombas&mdash;a
thousand devils, 'tis time to end this!'
exclaimed du Platel, grinding his teeth,
and then they bore her away from me.
</p>

<p>
"In three days after this sorrowful
meeting I heard the bells of St. Germain
de Prè ringing gaily for the marriage of
Isabelle to the wealthy citizen d'Escombas,
who was willing to take her without a
portion&mdash;a circumstance that had quite
sufficient influence with one so sordid and
cruel as her father, without considering
on the other hand the vast wealth of her
suitor.
</p>

<p>
"After this, I was long ill and tired
of life, and believe that but for the
unwearying friendship of Guillaume de
Boisguiller I should have died&mdash;if
indeed people ever die for love, which I
don't think they do.
</p>

<p>
"It was about this time that all Paris,
and all France, too, rung with the terrible
story of the conspiracy, the trial, and
execution of Robert Francis Damien; and
M. d'Escombas, on hearing that I was
ill, affected to pity me, and begged of
Boisguiller that he might be permitted
to pay me a visit.  Then I&mdash;urged I
know not by what motive or impulse&mdash;consented.
On hearing this, what think
you my fortunate rival did?&mdash;for all his
plans we discovered after&mdash;how, need not
be related here.
</p>

<p>
"He unlocked the secret drawer of an
iron strong-box, and taking therefrom a
ring, placed it, with a peculiar smile, upon
a finger of his right hand.  It was a large
and antique ring, which his father, who
was a dealer in jewellery, had procured in
Venice at a sale of the trinkets of the old
Doge, Marc Antonio Mocenigo, who
became the spouse of the Adriatic in 1701.
This gold ornament was what was then
termed a <i>Death Ring</i>, used when acts of
poisoning were common in the
seventeenth century.  It was of the purest
metal; but attached to the outside were
two lion's claws, made of the keenest steel,
and having in each a cleft that was filled
with the most deadly poison.
</p>

<p>
"In crowds, or balls, or elsewhere, the
wearer of such a ring could exercise his
secret revenge by the slightest scratch,
in pressing the hand of the doomed
person, who would next day be found,
perhaps, in bed dead, no one knew why or
how.  So, armed with this most fatal
trinket, M. d'Escombas came with
Boisguiller to visit <i>me</i>.
</p>

<p>
"I have but a vague recollection of the
interview.  He knew how passionately I
had loved Isabelle, and I saw the savage
gleam that crossed his eyes, when I
inquired for her, but as one might inquire for
a sister.  He assured me in brief and
hurried terms that she was well, content,
and happy.  Then I congratulated him
with a tongue that clove to the roof of
my mouth.
</p>

<p>
"He rose, at last, to retire; bade me
be of good heart, said his adieux, and
pressing my hand, left me, with a dark
smile in his eyes, which were small, black,
glittering, and half obscured by their
shaggy overhanging brows of grizzly hair,
which, in fact, were like mustachios
placed over his nose instead of below it.
</p>

<p>
"Scarcely was he gone before I felt
an indescribable sensation pass over all my
body; my eyesight grew dim; my brain
reeled, and my thoughts became delirious.
Then every faculty seemed to become
paralysed, and the doctors&mdash;in his
excitement Boisguiller soon had half the
medical faculty of Paris at my
bedside&mdash;declared that I had been poisoned by
some mineral substance.  But poisoned
by <i>whom</i>, and <i>how</i>?  Ah, <i>le brigand!</i> how
little did we suspect!
</p>

<p>
"Strong antidotes were applied, and
after a time I recovered, for the poison in
the ring had been placed there so many
years ago that it had not retained sufficient
strength to destroy life; but I leave
you, Monsieur Gauntlet, to imagine the
hatred and horror I had of the traitor
d'Escombas when I came to know the
actual object of his visit.
</p>

<p>
"I recovered fully, and joined the army
under the Marshals Contades and de
Broglie, in Germany.  So my Isabelle is
still the wife of that man; but there is a
sweet composure, a sadness of heart and
of eye about her, a silence and enduring
gentleness under the most insulting
jealousy and coarse petty tyranny, which
make all who know, pity her, and deplore
the fate to which she has been consigned.
</p>

<p>
"Had she died I should have sorrowed
for her long and deeply, and have
eventually recovered from the shock; but to
know that she lives, and for <i>another</i>, is
enough to&mdash;but, hola! what have we here?"

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
A SAD CONCLUSION.
</h3>

<p>
The interruption to the story was caused
by Gervais Monjoy observing that before
us rose the ivy-covered ruins of an ancient
schloss, which seemed to inform him, as
he said, that in the interest which he
took in his unfortunate love affair he had
lost or mistaken the way.
</p>

<p>
We were on the brow of a high eminence,
and far away in distance spread
the snowy landscape.  In the foreground
were some leafless woods and ridges of
rock, which like the ruins of the old castle
shone in russet and pink, as the yellow
and rosy dawn stole across the eastern
quarter of the sky.  A star or two still
twinkled overhead, and one shone brightly
through the gaping windows of the square
keep of the old schloss.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Morbleu</i>, my friend! my mind has
been so full of Isabelle that I have proved
but an indifferent guide.  We are on the
road to Waldeck.  That is the old castle
of Count Heinrich, who slew Ferdinand
of Brunswick at Fritzlar, in 1400.
Let me consider.  We are not very far
from Zuschen, and a bend of the Lahn
lies about two miles distant on our right.
Fortunately here is a peasant.  Halloa! my
friend, who or what are you?" asked
Monjoy, in German, as a man attired in
an overcoat of some dark stuff trimmed
with black wolf's fur, and wearing a cap
and boots of deerskin, with a horn-hafted
knife in his girdle, a musket in his hand,
and attended by a dog, appeared by the
wayside, where he was leisurely lighting
his large pipe, and quietly surveying us
while doing so.
</p>

<p>
"I am a woodman," he answered somewhat gruffly.
</p>

<p>
"You are abroad betimes, friend."
</p>

<p>
"Those who have their bread to earn
in a country swarming with soldiers, who
help themselves to the best of everything,
have need to be so, Mein Herr."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know the Lahn?"
</p>

<p>
"Right well.  I am Karl Karsseboom,
a forester of the Baron Von Freyenthal.
This path to the right will bring you to it
straight.  Two miles from this is the ford;
the water is shallow and frozen; but the
King of Prussia's Black Hussars are in a
village on the other side, so be wary."
</p>

<p>
"My friend, we thank you," said Monjoy,
as the peasant touched his fur cap
respectfully, and, with his musket
shouldered, strode off, not in search of game, as
we thought then, but to fulfil his duty of
scout, by acquainting some followers of
Bourgneuf that I was to cross the Lahn
at the frozen ford.
</p>

<p>
"I have seen you some fifteen miles or
so on your way," said my companion,
gradually reining in his horse, "and
further would I go, monsieur, but for
those plans of Dillenburg which I must
lay before the maréchal, and which
our friend Boisguiller must convey to
head-quarters.  Farewell: I have enjoyed
much the few hours we have had of your
society; but the best we can wish each
other, if this war lasts, is that we may
seldom or never meet again, as we shall
only do so when bayonets are fixed and
bullets are flying."
</p>

<p>
Monjoy shook my hand, and wheeling
round his horse, rode off.  I remained for
some minutes watching his retiring figure,
the shadow of which was thrown across
the snow by the rising sun, in the light
of which his silver epaulettes flashed and
glittered, and in the clear frosty air
the echoes of his horse's hoofs long came
distinctly ringing to the car.
</p>

<p>
I felt depressed and lonely now, for the
suavity of manner and gentleness of
expression possessed by this young officer
made him a singularly winning and
pleasing companion.
</p>

<p>
How much more would I have been
interested in him then, could I have
foreseen his terrible future!
</p>

<p>
Turning, I rode slowly along the path
indicated.  It was distinctly visible even
amid the snow, as day had dawned and
the sun was up; and while I traversed it
at an easy pace (my horse being indifferently
frosted in the shoes, and halting at
every step), with the reader's permission
I will give him&mdash;may I add, <i>her</i>?&mdash;the
sad sequel to the story of Monjoy, as
I afterwards read it in the <i>Mercure
Français</i>, and the <i>Gazette de Bruxelles</i>, in
our camp at Warburg in Prussian Westphalia.
</p>

<p>
Monjoy returned to Paris with Maréchal
de Contades, the Marquis de Voyer,
the Comte de Luc, and other officers who
declined for various admitted reasons to
serve under the Duc de Broglie, and he
lived there a somewhat secluded life,
exerting himself sedulously in the study of
his profession.  But he could not fail to
hear from time to time of her he had lost,
and how the neglect, and what was worse,
the querulous tyranny, even the <i>blows</i>, of
M. d'Escombas she endured with meek
and silent patience&mdash;a patience that galled
Monjoy; for as year succeeded year she
had become the mere nurse of a petulant
and selfish old man.
</p>

<p>
"Many a good woman's life is no more
cheerful," says a certain writer; "a
spring of beauty and sunshine; a bitter
disappointment, followed by pangs and
frantic tears, and then a long, long and
monotonous story of submission."
</p>

<p>
As yet such had been the tenor of the
life of Isabelle, but never did she and
Gervais meet, save once in the boxes of
the Opera House of the Palais Royal&mdash;the
same theatre which had been built of old
by Cardinal Richelieu, and was burned
down four years after Minden.
</p>

<p>
They were seated very near each other.
She seemed wondrously pale and beautiful;
she was clad in light blue silk,
her delicate neck, her white taper arms,
and her golden hair all glittering with
diamonds&mdash;the badges of her wedded
slavery.
</p>

<p>
Both were deeply agitated, but neither
spoke, till Isabelle, unable to restrain her
emotion, whispered to Monjoy behind
her fan&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I can read your secret in your eyes,
my poor Gervais, and so will others if
you do not retire."
</p>

<p>
"My secret?" he faltered.
</p>

<p>
"That you love me&mdash;love me still,
though I am the slave of this Dives.
Oh, my God! fly me&mdash;leave me to my
misery&mdash;a misery known to myself and
Heaven only!"
</p>

<p>
Almost suffocated by his emotions&mdash;the
grief and tenderness the familiar
sound of her voice and this pathetic
appeal all served to kindle in his breast,
he rose abruptly and quitted the theatre,
followed by a threatening glance from
d'Escombas.
</p>

<p>
That evening he wandered long about
the streets, but an irresistible fatality
always lured him towards the Rue de
Tournon, where Isabelle resided.
</p>

<p>
The night came on, clear and cold;
there was no moon, but the stars shone
brightly, and he saw all the windows of
the street glittering in their pale light,
and those also in that noble façade of the
palace of the Luxembourg which faces
the Rue de Tournon, with its pavilions
at each end, and the great cupola which
rises above the entrance door.
</p>

<p>
While wandering here, a person jostled
him with great rudeness, and turning
with a hand on his sword, he encountered
the remarkably forbidding and somewhat
grizzled visage of&mdash;&mdash;M. d'Escombas!
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur will apologize?" said Monjoy
in a husky voice, after recovering from
his surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur will do nothing of the
kind," growled the old man.  "What the
devil brings you here, Gervais Monjoy?
But it matters nothing to me&mdash;so you had
better walk off, and take your hand from
your sword, or <i>parbleu!</i> remember that
I have the same cane for you that has
made Madame d'Escombas wince more
than once!"
</p>

<p>
Maddened by the insult, the man, his
words and the inferences to be drawn
from them, Monjoy prayed aloud&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Great source of strength, assist me!
Beware! old man," he added, "lest you
drive me to despair.  Remember that it is
neither the sixth nor the seventh
commandment in the Decalogue that may
prevent me from punishing you as you
deserve, and rescuing a poor victim from
your tyranny."
</p>

<p>
M. d'Escombas, who was insanely
jealous, grew white and livid with rage at
these words; and, as he did not want for
courage, laid his hand on his walking
sword, for people still wore such weapons
at night in the streets of Paris.
</p>

<p>
"Dare you say this to me?" he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Oui, monsieur le scélérat</i>, and more if I
choose.  A selfish father sells his timid
daughter to a sordid wretch who buys
her for rank.  Was it not so, old man?"
</p>

<p>
"Granted&mdash;though she preferred a
beggarly student who should have stuck
to his Vauban and his Coehorn," said the
other, grinding his teeth; "and what
then?"
</p>

<p>
"Coldness and placid endurance of
life&mdash;perhaps contentment, might have
followed; but never happiness."
</p>

<p>
"But for what, you would say?"
</p>

<p>
"Your querulous tyranny&mdash;your unmanly
cruelty, with the story of which
all Paris rings.  You have even dared to
strike her&mdash;to strike her with your
clenched hand, and even with your cane.
Oh, malediction, my gentle Isabelle! and
here, old man, I tell you <i>you are a
coward</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"A coward&mdash;and your Isabelle! ha&mdash;we
shall see what we shall see," exclaimed
d'Escombas, boiling with ungovernable
fury, as he swiftly drew his sword, and
rushing upon Monjoy before the latter
was aware, wounded him severely in the
side.
</p>

<p>
This was too much for human endurance.
The engineer drew his sword, and locking
in, tossed up, or wrenched away the
weapon of M. d'Escombas, which glittered
in the starlight as the blade went twenty
feet into the air.  At the same moment
the sword of Monjoy pierced the lungs of
his adversary, who, as he whirled round
in his agony before falling, received it a
second time in his back.  He fell on his
face and expired without a groan, and
Monjoy fled, full of horror, leaving his
weapon in the street, behind him.
</p>

<p>
All that dreadful night he wandered
about the streets, the quays, and bridges
of Paris, haunted by what seemed a
dream, a nightmare, to endure for ever;
and when day dawned he repaired straight
to a Commissary (an official similar to
our justice of the peace) and declared
upon oath "that he had slain M. d'Escombas
in the Rue de Tournon; but in
a fair duel, sword in hand, in self-defence."
</p>

<p>
The Commissary deplored the circumstance,
but accepted the declaration, and
perceiving that he was dreadfully agitated,
gave him some wine and water.
</p>

<p>
"And now, dear Isabelle," he muttered
wildly, "you are free&mdash;but by my hand&mdash;alas,
by <i>my</i> hand!"
</p>

<p>
"How, monsieur," exclaimed the
Commissary, sharply, looking up from his
desk, and surveying the miserable
Monjoy through his spectacles&mdash;"what's this
you say?"
</p>

<p>
Monjoy remained silent, but grew, if
possible, paler.
</p>

<p>
"Hah! <i>mon Dieu</i>!" exclaimed the
Commissary, changing colour; "I
remember now.  Is it true that you were
a discarded lover of Madame, when she
was Mademoiselle du Platel, and a boarder
with les dames de Notre Dame de Charité
on du réfuge de St. Michel, in the Rue de
St. Jacques?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," moaned Monjoy; "it is too true."
</p>

<p>
"Detain M. Gervais Monjoy in custody;
send for a surgeon; bring the body of
M. d'Escombas here, and let us have
it examined," said the other to his
officials.
</p>

<p>
In less than an hour all this was done.
</p>

<p>
"How is this?" exclaimed the surgeon,
the Commissary; and all present; "there
is a sword wound <i>in the back</i>, and the
sword is still remaining there!"
</p>

<p>
"He has been murdered!" said the
Commissary, sternly.
</p>

<p>
"Dare you say so?" exclaimed Monjoy,
with equal fury and indignation.
</p>

<p>
"In my official capacity, I may say
anything," replied the commissary, with
a grimace&mdash;"to La Force with the prisoner!"
</p>

<p>
Within another hour Monjoy found
himself in that formidable prison&mdash;formerly
the hotel of the Maréchal Duc de
la Force&mdash;accused of murder.  Maréchal
de Contades was in disfavour at court;
Maréchal de Broglie was still in Germany,
where the Seven Years' War was raging
as fiercely as ever; his aunt the Prioress
was dead.  Thus Monjoy had no friend in
Paris, save <i>one</i>, for whom he dare not send;
so he remained in his vault, sunk in
misery, and careless for the future.
</p>

<p>
In this prison are detained until the day
of trial those who are accused of crimes.
It is a spacious edifice, divided into
several departments, and having eight courts,
all watched and guarded well.
</p>

<p>
At last, in the extremity of his misery.
he sent for Isabelle, that he might, to
her at least, absolve himself from the
crime of which he was accused.  She came
clad in deep mourning, and the meeting
between them was painful and affecting.
But as it was known that they had been
lovers in their youth, Paris was ready to
believe the worst; and as the sordid
M. du Platel and d'Escombas' kinsman, the
Governor of the Conciergerie, cried "fire
and sword" against them both, rumour
succeeded in having Madame accused of
being "art and part" in her husband's
death.  So she was arrested, and
committed to a separate vault in La Force,
one of the places named <i>les Secrets</i> in that
formidable edifice, which is formed
entirely of hewn stone and enormous bars
of iron, and in the construction of which
neither wood nor plaster are employed.
</p>

<p>
There they languished for many months
without a trial, as it happened that just
about this time the chief court of justice
in France, the <i>Parlement de Paris</i>&mdash;without
the full concurrence of which no
criminal can be arraigned&mdash;was removed,
first to Pontoise and thereafter to Soissons,
on account of their severe proceedings
against the Archbishop of Paris, who (to
repress the disorderly lives of the people)
had issued a pastoral letter "forbidding
all priests and curs to administer the
sacrament to any one, no matter of what
rank, unless they could produce a certificate
from their father confessor"&mdash;a pastoral
which gave great offence to the court
of the Most Christian king.
</p>

<p>
To be brief: when the Court ultimately
assembled, poor Monjoy was brought to
trial, and on being put to torture
admitted that he was guilty of the murder
in the Rue de Tournon, and consequently
was sentenced to be broken alive upon
the wheel.
</p>

<p>
When asked who were his accomplices,
amidst torments the most excruciating,
he persisted in affirming that he had none;
that Madame d'Escombas was guiltless
and pure as when she left her convent.
French medical skill was brought to bear
upon his quivering limbs, and then,
maddened by agony, he continued deliriously
to acknowledge himself guilty of the
murder again and again; but on being
questioned for the last time concerning Madame
d'Escombas, he accused her too!
</p>

<p>
On this the windlass of the rack was
instantly relaxed, and he fainted, with
blood pouring from his mouth and nostrils.
</p>

<p>
When his keener agony was over, on
his knees, before my old friend Père
Celestine (once curé of St. Solidore, and now
coadjutor Bishop of Paris), with tears of
blood and agony the unhappy Monjoy
retracted all that had been wrung from
him under torture; but it was too late.
</p>

<p>
On <i>his</i> accusation and confession she
too was tried, and sentenced to death,
and then both were committed to the
Conciergerie du Palais, and to the care
of that grim governor, the kinsman of
d'Escombas&mdash;he of whom Monjoy had
such an instinctive dread of old.
</p>

<p>
The entrance to this frightful old prison
is by a low and narrow door, over which
might well be carved the well-known line
from Dante's "Inferno."
</p>

<p>
Isabelle was conducted to the greffe or
female prison, by that sombre vestibule
which is lighted by lamps even at
mid-day; but Monjoy was thrust, bleeding
and mangled, perspiring in every limb
with recent torture, into one of the old
and dark dungeons of the Conciergerie,
from whence, after a time, they were both
conveyed in a tumbril, and clad in
sackcloth, to the Place de Greve, where she
was hanged by the neck, and he, after
making a pathetic declaration of her
innocence, underwent the dreadful death
of being broken alive upon the wheel!
</p>

<p>
With his last breath he implored the
executioner to see that a blue ribbon,
some gift of happier years, which he wore
round his neck, should be buried with
him.
</p>

<p>
Such was the miserable fate of this
young Frenchman who befriended me so
much at Ysembourg, and whom I last
saw galloping gallantly along the road
from the old ruined schloss, with his
epaulettes and gay uniform glittering in
the morning sunshine.
</p>

<p>
And now, with a pardon for this digression,
I return to my own more matter-of-fact story.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
THE FROZEN FORD.
</h3>

<p>
By a narrow path between leafless woods,
I proceeded for two miles in the direction
indicated by Monjoy, and then saw before
me the Lahn, a stream which rises in the
west of Germany, and, as any Gazetteer
will inform us, passes by the hill
which is crowned by the castle of
Marburg, the old Bailiwick of Giessen, the
walled town of Wetzlar, and the city of
Nassau (in which and in other places
along its banks we had garrisons or
outposts), until it flows into the famous Rhine
near Upper Lahnstein.
</p>

<p>
That portion of the stream which I
now approached, though broad, was
shallow and frozen hard.  Its banks were
thickly fringed by willow trees, amid
which the morning mist was rolling
lazily.  Here and there some of those
great masses of detached copper-coloured
rock which stud the scenery of Waldeck
overhung the stream, and had their bases
crusted with frozen foam.
</p>

<p>
The region being high and hilly, and
the season midwinter, the atmosphere was
intensely cold, yet I was dubious of the
strength of the ice, and feared that my
horse, with its wounded off hind leg, might
flounder and fall if its hoofs pierced the
covering of the stream.  As this idea
occurred to me I was about to dismount,
and hold the animal by the bridle, when
the appearance of a well-bearded human
visage regarding me steadily from a cleft
in the rocks, made me pause with a hand
on my holster-flap, a motion which made
the person instantly vanish.
</p>

<p>
The mist enveloping the willow-covered
bank I had to traverse before reaching the
stream was dense, and curling up in the
sunshine, and it seemed to me that certain
objects which at first resembled stumps of
trees suddenly took the form of men,
clad in white coats, the uniform of the
French line; and, as the event proved,
here were six men of the Regiment de
Bretagne, a foraging party suborned by
Bourgneuf to cut me off, and with them
was the identical peasant whom Monjoy
and I had met near the ruins of the old
schloss&mdash;Karl Karsseboom.
</p>

<p>
I had the marshal's signed passport,
but feared to ride forward or deliver it,
and for a time remained unchallenged and
irresolutely watching those men whose
white-clad figures amid the frosty mist
and tossing willows seemed indistinct and
wavering, like Banquo's shadowy line of
kings, or the weird sisters in "Macbeth."
</p>

<p>
I waved aloft the paper given me by
Bourgneuf, the immediate reply to which
was the levelling of four muskets; but
three flashed in the pan, the priming
having probably become wet over night.  The
bullet from the fourth, however, knocked
my grenadier cap awry.
</p>

<p>
I then shook a white handkerchief,
and demanded a parley; but a fifth and
sixth musket flashed redly out of the
white mist, making a hundred reverberations
amid the river's bed, and another
bullet grazed my left ear like a hot
searing-iron.  I was full of fury now, and while
these would-be assassins were casting
about and reloading, I heard a voice shout
clearly in French, and with a mocking
laugh&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Peste</i>!   Arnaud de Pricorbin&mdash;<i>il ne
sait pas distinguer une femme d'une
girouette!</i>"  (He knows not a woman from
a weathercock&mdash;meaning that he was a
bad shot, and could hit neither.)
</p>

<p>
The brother of the executed Volontaire
de Clermont was here, and had preceded
me to the ford; thus I was in peculiarly
bad hands it would appear.  Their six
muskets were unserviceable as yet, so,
spurring furiously, I rushed sword in
hand at the whole group, firing a pistol
and hurling it after the shot as I
advanced.
</p>

<p>
Gored by the spurs, the poor old horse
forgot his wound, and swept through my
adversaries, crashing among the frozen
willows, reeds, icicles, and rotten ice.  For
a moment I saw six fierce, dark-visaged
fellows, with white coats, red epaulets,
and black crossbelts, with their muskets
clubbed to beat me down.  By a
backhanded stroke I slashed one across the
face; but at the same moment a bayonet
pierced my horse in the bowels, and he
received a long wound that ripped open
his near hind flank; this was from the
musket of the German forester, who
levelled it deliberately over a fragment of
rock.
</p>

<p>
Maddened by pain and fury, the animal
reared wildly back upon its haunches, and
then, instead of riding towards the ford,
swerved round, and treading some of our
assailants under his hoofs, galloped straight
along a road which led towards Wildungen,
in a direction nearly opposite to that
I wished to pursue.
</p>

<p>
Wild, terrified, and dying, with the bit
clenched tightly between his teeth, the
horse was for a time quite unmanageable,
and I had not power to stop him, even if
inclined to do so, which I certainly was
not, until beyond musket range of the
discomfited rascals who guarded the
frozen ford.
</p>

<p>
In short, I was borne away by my
wounded horse in a manner nearly similar
to that which had occurred after one of
our skirmishes with the French Hussars
in Brittany.  I know not why it was,
but I felt more excited by this encounter
than by the whole day at Minden,
and when riding on, seemed still to
hear the report of the muskets, and to
see them flashing out of the mist
before me.
</p>

<p>
Dropping blood and foam upon the
snow with every bound, the poor animal,
covered with perspiration and enveloped
in a steam induced by the frosty air,
carried me a few miles almost at racing
speed.  This, however, slacked suddenly,
and on coming to a thicket where a spring
(the water of which had a warm or
peculiar mineral property, as it was quite
unfrozen) flowed freely, I rode for nearly a
mile up its bed or course, so that if
followed by Arnaud de Pricorbin and other
faithful Bretons of the Comte de Bourgneuf,
the track of blood so visible in the
snow would be lost in the running
stream.
</p>

<p>
Perceiving a sequestered cottage upon
the slope of a hill, sheltered by some great
fir trees, I approached it, and was made
welcome by the occupants, who appeared
to be only a poor woman and her blind
daughter; but they had no fear of me, as
my uniform showed them&mdash;the former at
least&mdash;that I was one of those who had
come to assist in freeing Westphalia and
Waldeck from those unscrupulous invaders,
the French.
</p>

<p>
With some difficulty I made them
understand, by a broken jargon, that we had
been engaged in a skirmish, and that my
horse had been wounded.  It was placed
in an outhouse or shed, where a cow was
munching some chopped straw and frozen
turnips.  I removed the heavy demi-pique
saddle, bridle, and holsters, putting the
remaining pistol in my belt.  While doing
so the poor animal, lying among the
straw, with its bowels protruding through
the bayonet wound, whinnied and rubbed
its nose upon the sleeve of my red coat,
as if recognising the <i>colour</i>; and in that
lonely place I felt as if I had lost my only
friend, when the old grey trooper died
about two hours after.
</p>

<p>
I remember partaking with the poor
cottager and her blind daughter of a
savoury dish of stewed hare, which had
been netted by herself in the adjacent fir
thicket.  We had also a warm jug of
mulled Wildungen beer, making a repast
for which I was both grateful and well
appetized, after the adventures of so cold
a morning.  I ate and drank to strengthen
me for whatever might follow, as I was
still in the land of toil and danger; and
for the same end I carefully re-charged,
primed, and flinted anew my solitary
pistol, and then slept for an hour or so
by the peasant's fire of turf, wood, and
fir-cones.
</p>

<p>
By the devious course of the river it
would appear that I was still only a few
miles from the Lahn; but I knew that if
Arnaud de Pricorbin escaped my scuffle
with him and his comrades, it would be duly
reported to the Count that I was yet on
the French side of the stream; thus more
ample means would be taken by him to
guard it, and to cut me off at any possible
point elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
In the distance I could see the quaint
old city of Wildungen, seated between
two snow-clad mountains, with the dun
smoke of its winter fires ascending into
the clear, cold sky.  At one time I thought
of venturing there and endeavouring
to procure a guide or escort from any
French officer who was in command; and
either one or other the Duke's passport
would certainly have procured me; but
whom might I meet on the way? was the
next idea.
</p>

<p>
The jealousy of Bourgneuf was so
insane, and his whole proceedings were so
cruel and unwarrantable, that my heart
boiled with rage against him; and in this
new cause for anger I forgot even Shirley,
whose jealousy in another matter had cast
me into these toils by an effort of
cunning and poltroonery which I hoped one
day to requite, and amply too.
</p>

<p>
Resolving to wait until nightfall, and
then set forth alone, I passed the day
at the cottage of the peasant woman, who
urged me to await the return of her
husband, who had been absent all day with
his gun in search of a deer, and could
guide me with certainty.
</p>

<p>
"What is he?" I inquired, carelessly.
</p>

<p>
"A forester of the Baron Von Freyenthal."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!" said I, becoming suddenly
interested.  "I met such a person this
morning.  Does he wear a fur cap and
deerskin boots, and has he a large black
shaggy wolf dog?"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly, Mein Herr&mdash;you have met
my husband Karl Karsseboom and his
dog Jager."
</p>

<p>
"If I meet him again!" thought I,
with a hand on my pistol.
</p>

<p>
After this information, and the discovery
of who was my landlord (ah! if the
fellow had returned when I was asleep!)
I resolved to lose no time in endeavouring
to reach the ford of the Lahn at any risk.
Whoever was there, the night would favour
me, and I was alike forewarned and forearmed.
</p>

<p>
I studied closely the features of the
country from the cottage window, and
repeatedly consulted a little pocket map
of the principality of Waldeck, which
had been given to me by Gervais Monjoy,
two means of topographical knowledge
that availed me little, when, a few hours
after, without encountering the amiable
Karl Karsseboom, I found myself on the
rugged German highway alone, bewildered,
and floundering along in the dark
in my military jack-boots, with a heavy
storm of snow drifting in my face, and the
stormy and frosty north wind, which was
so keen and cold that at times it
well-nigh choked me.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
LAST OF THE EMERALD RING.
</h3>

<p>
The snow-flakes were thick and blinding;
the roadway became less and less
discernible as the white mantle of winter
deepened; buried under it, shrubs, tall
weeds, and everything that could mark
the borders of the path, a very rough and
occasionally steep one, disappeared, and I
wandered on wearily and at random
without knowing in what direction.
</p>

<p>
There was no one abroad at such an
hour and in such a season, and no house
was visible, for the district was wild and
desolate, having been severely devastated
by the French foragers.
</p>

<p>
No sound came to the ear but the occasional
hiss of the sharp hail that mingled
with the falling snow, rendering the
winter blast more chilly, choking, and biting,
till the lungs became acutely pained, and
the heart throbbed wildly.
</p>

<p>
How far I struggled on inspiring that
icy atmosphere I cannot say, but nature
was beginning to sink, and in my heart
grew the fear of being conquered
altogether, and of perishing in the storm,
when happily a light that shone down
what appeared to be a kind of ravine or
trench (I know not which with certainty,
as the snow caused all forms and features
to blend) filled me with new strength, and
manfully I made towards it, keeping in
the track or line it cast so brightly
towards me.
</p>

<p>
Ere long I could discover other lights
that shone high above me in the air;
then all at once the outline of a great old
schloss or castle loomed through the
snowy atmosphere, and the light which
had been my guide shone apparently from
a window in the lower story of the edifice.
This suggested ideas of robbers, for who
has not heard or read of German robbers
and their haunts in ruined castles of the
Black Forest, or by the Rhine and Weser?
A French outpost perhaps!  Well, it
mattered not; anything&mdash;even a few of
the Volontaires de Clermont were better
hosts than the snow and Jack Frost in
such a night and in such a season.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a cry escaped me, when,
half-stifled in snow, I sank to the
armpits&mdash;yea, to the very neck, struggling and
floundering like a drowning man.  In
fact, I had tumbled into the dry ditch of
the schloss, which was nearly filled with
drifted snow, and across which I scrambled
with great difficulty towards the light.
Thrice I nearly surrendered altogether,
before, panting, breathless, and chilled to
the heart's core, I reached a kind of
terrace, approached the window, and peeped in.
</p>

<p>
Between tapestry hangings and white
curtains of Mechlin lace, there could be
seen a cosy little room, lined with dark
brown wainscot, the varnished panels of
which shone in the light of a cheerful fire.
Drapery also of Mechlin lace overhung
an elegant bed, a handsome mirror, and
toilet-table, on which were placed four
tall candles in solid stands of mahogany
and silver.
</p>

<p>
There were one or two ebony Dutch
cabinets, on which stood rare Japan
canisters, quaint Chinese figures, an ormolu
clock, and various pretty <i>bijouterie</i>, and
there reigned within a sense of warmth,
perfume, and comfort, that reached even
to my chilly post without the casement.
</p>

<p>
But now, through the large pattern
of the Mechlin lace hangings, I could
discern two female figures near the
fireplace; they were each kneeling at a
carved oak <i>prie-dieu</i>, saying their prayers
and warming themselves at the same time,
thus combining their comfort with their
piety.  By her dress, and the contour of
her head and shoulders, one appeared to
be a lady; the other an attendant.
Benumbed to agony, I felt dreamy,
bewildered, and knew not what to do; sleep
seemed to be stealing over my senses.
</p>

<p>
What if all I saw was an illusion, and
these two fair ones were but Lurlies, like
those who haunted the Lurliberg?  What
if the whole affair proved a dream, from
which I should waken, if I ever woke at
all, to find myself amid the snow-clad
ruins of some old haunted schloss beside
the Lahn?&mdash;for such is the plot of many
a German story.
</p>

<p>
But when they rose from prayer I was
quickly undeceived, and a cry almost
escaped me on recognising Jacqueline de
Broglie and her pretty attendant, the
waggish Angelique!
</p>

<p>
Some minutes elapsed before I could
sufficiently master my emotions to enable
me to observe them particularly.  Both
seemed almost as unchanged as when we
were together in the old château,
especially Madame Tricot, the pretty piquante
and black-eyed Bretonne.  (Ah, she had
soon tired of her M. Jacquot, who perhaps
had given himself too many airs on
becoming coachman to the coadjutor Bishop
of Paris.)  And she was here now with her
former mistress (and mine too) in
Germany, the land of the Seven Years' War.
</p>

<p>
The soft and charming features, the
dark hair and eyes of Jacqueline, her air
and manner, were all as I had seen
them&mdash;not last, when lying, as it would seem,
lifeless in the forest, but as they had been
in our happier times.  She was beautiful
as ever; but the slightest symptom of
dark down, like a shade, was visible at
each corner of her pretty mouth&mdash;a
symptom not uncommon among Frenchwomen
after their twentieth year.
</p>

<p>
What was I to do now?  To advance
was to run into the jaws of danger; to
retire was to perish amid the drifting
snow, and already the very marrow seemed
frozen in my bones.  As she said something
to Angelique, a thrill passed through
me at the sound of her voice; something
of my old love swelled up in my heart,
and then pique repressed it; she seemed
so happy and so smiling!
</p>

<p>
Had she been compelled to marry
Bourgneuf?  But, save her love, what
was there to tie her unto me after I had
disappeared from the château?
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the window against which I
pressed (till my nose, had it been
observed, must have presented a very livid
aspect), and which had not been bolted,
parted in two leaves that opened inwards,
and heavily and awkwardly, with a shower
of snow, I fell headlong into the apartment,
and almost at the feet of Jacqueline,
who, with her attendant, uttered a cry of
terror; but both speedily recovered their
presence of mind.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mon Dieu!</i> what is this?&mdash;a drunken
soldier!" exclaimed the first, with great
asperity.
</p>

<p>
"A mousquetaire rouge&mdash;<i>Grand Dieu!</i>
'tis an Englishman!  We shall all be
murdered.  Help! help!" cried Madame
Tricot, with new dismay.
</p>

<p>
"Jacqueline&mdash;Jacqueline! for Heaven's
sake, hush!  Have you quite forgotten
me, Basil Gauntlet, and our pleasant days
in old Bretagne?" I exclaimed, in an
excited and imploring tone.
</p>

<p>
Terror, surprise, and anything but real
pleasure, filled the eyes of Jacqueline us
she recognised me.  She trembled, and
held up her hands as if to shield her
averted face and keep me back; but this
was needless, as I never approached, but
stood near the open window, through
which came the drifting snow and the
night wind that waved the hangings.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jacqueline!" said I, while an
irrepressible emotion of tenderness filled my
heart, "how terrible was the time when
last I saw you stretched upon the earth
in the forest of St. Aubin de Cormier!&mdash;and
why do you greet me so coldly now?"
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur," said Angelique, taking
my hands kindly in hers, "she greets you
as people of the world greet those whom
they are anxious to forget."
</p>

<p>
"With a fearful and cold welcome,
Angelique?"
</p>

<p>
"True, <i>mon ami</i>, it is so."
</p>

<p>
"Then I pray you to pardon this intrusion,"
said I, hurriedly; "in seeking
the British lines I have lost my way, and
my life is beset by other dangers than the
winter storm.  Tell me where the Lahn
lies, and I shall go; but pity me,
Jacqueline, for Heaven and my own heart alone
know how well I loved you."
</p>

<p>
There was a gratified smile on her
lovely lip; a <i>smile</i>&mdash;and at such a
time&mdash;it went a long way to cure me of my
folly.
</p>

<p>
"<i>O, mon pauvre Basil!</i> and so it is
really you?" said she, regarding me with
a certain vague interest sparkling in her
fine dark eyes; "but here, at this time of
night," she continued with alarm&mdash;"and
the count&mdash;I expect him every moment!
You know that I am married, do you not?
Get him away&mdash;away from here.  Oh,
Angelique, where are your brains?  Aid us,
or he is lost, and I too, perhaps!"
</p>

<p>
"Lost, indeed!" I repeated, bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Guillaume de Boisguiller, whom you
found in that horrid English prison-ship,
told you all about my marriage, did he
not?" said Jacqueline, earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, madame."
</p>

<p>
"And you did not die of a broken heart?"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all, madame; I can assure
you that broken hearts are articles quite
as rare among us in England as with you
in France."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, indeed!" said she, smiling again.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis so," said I, with a laugh, which
sounded strangely in my own ears, and in
which she joined, giving her shoulders
the while a little French shrug.
</p>

<p>
And this was the Jacqueline about
whom I had sighed, raved, and wept!  So
here was an extinction of love, and a great
demolition of romance at one fell blow.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me where the Lahn lies, madame,
and I shall not trouble you with my
presence for a moment longer.  I am in
constant danger of my life, for your
husband seeks to destroy me, and without a
reason."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Grands Dieux!</i>" she exclaimed, with
real alarm, "are you the fugitive to secure
whom Bourgneuf has dispatched men in
so many directions?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, madame; so permit me to restore
to you this emerald ring.  It nearly cost
me my life, and yet it won me my liberty
yesterday at Ysembourg."
</p>

<p>
"From whom?" she asked, hurriedly.
</p>

<p>
"Your gallant old father, the Duc de
Broglie."
</p>

<p>
Then drawing her ring from my finger,
I laid it on the toilet-table with the air of
Cromwell ordering the removal of "that
bauble," the mace.
</p>

<p>
"He has no less than three parties out
to cut you off&mdash;one in the direction of
Hesse Cassel&mdash;one on the road to
Wildungen&mdash;and a third at the ford near
Zuschen, under Arnaud de Pricorbin."
</p>

<p>
"The bridges&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Alas! are all destroyed, and though
a plank might aid you in crossing the
one at Freyenthal, I heard him say that
the Baron Konrad watches all the
riverside with his foresters to prevent your
passage.  <i>Mon Dieu!</i> what shall be done?"
</p>

<p>
"Let me forth into the night again,"
said I, turning; "anywhere is better than
here.  Adieu, madame, adieu, and for
ever!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Hola! mon bon Monsieur Gauntlet</i>; so
we meet again, do we?" exclaimed a
familiar voice; and a cry escaped the
women, when I found myself confronted
by the Count de Bourgneuf, who shrugged
his shoulders in the true French style, till
his epaulettes touched his ears, while a
fierce, ironical, and almost diabolical smile
spread over his visage, and he ground his
teeth.  "<i>Aha, mon garcon!</i>" he continued,
making me a series of mock bows, and
then I perceived that he had a cocked
pistol dangling in each hand: "so I've
caught you at last, eh?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap14"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
THE WHISPERED ORDER.
</h3>

<p>
In his rage, Bourgneuf, with each
ironical bow, shook from his brigadier wig
the white powder which he wore in great
profusion.
</p>

<p>
The danger was imminent; peril menaced
me in front and rear; the winter
storm without, and an absurdly jealous
foe within.  I drew the pistol from my
belt; but, alas! the pan was open, and
the snow, when I fell into the ditch of
the schloss, had replaced the priming.  It
was useless; however, as Bourgneuf was
levelling his first weapon at my head, I
rushed upon him, struck up the muzzle
with my left hand, so that in exploding
the ball pierced the ceiling.  With my
pistol-butt I struck the weapon from his
other hand, and seized him by the throat;
but the room was almost immediately
filled by soldiers of the Regiment de
Bretagne, who beat me down and disarmed me.
</p>

<p>
The count drew my sword from its
scabbard, and contemptuously snapped the
blade under his foot, saying, "<i>Ha! pst-sacré
coquin-pst!</i>" as I was dragged into
another apartment, and the door of the
countess's room was closed and locked
upon her and her attendant, whose cries
I could hear ringing through the mansion;
and as they seemed the prelude to some
deed of cruelty and violence, I felt that
in hands so unscrupulous I was helpless
and completely lost.
</p>

<p>
However, I did not give in without a
desperate struggle.  From Tom Kirkton,
who in his wilder days had practised at
Marybone and Hockly-in-the-Hole, I had
picked up a little of the good old English
science of self-defence, so I struck out right
and left, and knocked over the crapauds
like ninepins, till the butt-end of a musket
laid me on the field of battle, and for a time
I thought all was over.
</p>

<p>
I was now rifled.  The two louis of
kind Boisguiller were speedily appropriated.
The pass of the Duc de Broglie
and the little laced handkerchief of Aurora,
which I still preserved as a souvenir of
my only relative, were handed to the
count.  He laughed at the first, but the
sight of the second transported him with
a fury only equal to that of the Moor on
the loss of that important handkerchief
which the Egyptian to his mother gave,
and which had "magic in the web of it."
</p>

<p>
"Count Bourgneuf," I exclaimed, resolutely,
on recovering my breath, for
timidity, I found, would be of little avail
here; "you have in your hand the signed
passport of the Duc de Broglie; how dare
you thus to violate it?"
</p>

<p>
"Dare&mdash;<i>parbleu!</i> from whom did you
receive it?"
</p>

<p>
"From yourself, in presence of
M. Monjoy and the Chevalier de Boisguiller."
</p>

<p>
"Signed, you say?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;look at it."
</p>

<p>
"I <i>have</i> looked; but it bears a signature
Monseigneur de Broglie would scarcely
recognise, and which no French soldier is
bound to respect."
</p>

<p>
"A forgery!  Mean you to say that it
is a forgery of yours?" I exclaimed,
furiously.
</p>

<p>
"Term it as you please," said he,
tearing the paper to pieces; "'tis thus that I
respect it."
</p>

<p>
"The duke released me," I began,
with some emotion of alarm&mdash;"released
me on parole, and complimented
me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Because you saved the life of his
daughter from an outlaw&mdash;or pretend that
you did so."
</p>

<p>
"But you, her husband, M. le Comte&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Mean to put you to death as a spy,
who remained as such in Bretagne for
several weeks, and who now as a prisoner
seeks to escape, after lurking behind the
French lines, of which the river Lahn is
the present boundary."
</p>

<p>
"Say, rather," said I, with unwise
bitterness, "that with a jealous cowardice
which has no parallel, you resolve to
destroy me as one who loved the countess
before she had the misfortune to become
your wife."
</p>

<p>
Enraged that this remark was made
before the listening soldiers who crowded
all the room, Bourgneuf said, with an oath
and a scornful laugh&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Ha!&mdash;think you so?"
</p>

<p>
"I both think and say so."
</p>

<p>
"What an intolerable world it would
be if every man said all he thought, as
you do; but I will meet you with the
sword if you choose."
</p>

<p>
"I will not fight with a would-be
assassin."
</p>

<p>
"The pistol then," he continued, grinding
his teeth.
</p>

<p>
"I will not fight with an assassin, even
though he wear the uniform of a colonel
of the French Line," I replied, resolutely,
though the soldiers began to mutter
angrily, and beat the floor with the butts
of their muskets.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bah&mdash;-pst! ce pistolet est en arrêt!</i>"
said Bourgneuf, turning on his heel with
a sneer on his cruel lip, and this pet
phrase of the French soldiers (implying
the "white feather") so enraged me, that I
could with pleasure have pistolled him
on the spot.
</p>

<p>
Looking round for a man in whom
he could trust, he selected a corporal, a
most sinister-looking fellow, whose nose
was quite awry, and whose shaggy
eyebrows met over it in one.  To him he
gave a <i>whispered order</i>, and though my
ear was painfully acute at such a time, I
could only detect the words, "distance&mdash;sound
of firing might not disturb&mdash;buried
in the snow."
</p>

<p>
The man with the crooked nose and
huge chevrons saluted his colonel, and
desired me to follow him, which I did
immediately, conceiving that my chances
were always better with one man than with
a score.  As we left the room a gleam of
triumphant malice sparkled in the eyes of
Bourgneuf, and he gave me an ironical bow.
</p>

<p>
When <i>next</i> I saw his face its expression
was very different.
</p>

<p>
In the vestibule of the schloss, which was
full of sleeping soldiers, the corporal
summoned a personage, in whom I
recognised Karl Karsseboom, in whose ear
he repeated the order of the count,
and muttering curses at the trouble I
caused them, these two worthies, after
carefully loading their muskets, desired
me gruffly to follow them, and leaving the
schloss by a drawbridge which spanned
the snow-filled ditch, we set forth, on what
errand I knew not.
</p>

<p>
The storm of wind and snow was over
now.  Morning was at hand; the stars
shone clear and brilliantly, and so
bright was the reflection of the snow
that every object could be discerned as
distinctly as at noon-day.  The silence
was profound; even our foot-falls were
muffled in the white waste, from amid
which the fir-trees stood up like sheeted
spectres.
</p>

<p>
I was weary and chilled, being without
any muffling; my head was giddy with
the recent blow, and the keen frosty air
affected me severely.
</p>

<p>
I asked the corporal if they were
conducting me to the ford of the Lahn.
</p>

<p>
"Not quite so far," replied he, gruffly.
</p>

<p>
My unexpected interview with Jacqueline,
her coolness, her general bearing, had
all bewildered me, and painfully wounded
my self-esteem and pride, crushing my old
love, and creating an emotion that wavered
between wonder and&mdash;shall I term it
so?&mdash;disgust.  She had proved so cold-blooded,
so&mdash;but enough of Jacqueline; let me to
my story, or we shall never make an end.
</p>

<p>
Again I asked my guides whither they
were conveying me, and their object?
</p>

<p>
"Beelzebub!" muttered the corporal;
"how impatient you are.  You will find
out too soon, perhaps.  Karl, are we a
mile from the schloss yet?"
</p>

<p>
"Scarcely," grumbled Karsseboom,
looking back.
</p>

<p>
I recalled the whispered order of Bourgneuf,
and the terrible conviction came upon
me that I was to be conducted to the
<i>distance</i> of a mile or so, where the <i>sound
of firing might not disturb</i> the countess&mdash;to
be there shot and <i>buried in the snow</i>!
</p>

<p>
Thus did a keen sense of danger supply
the wanting words.
</p>

<p>
What was I to do&mdash;unarmed, weak,
weary, and powerless?  I could grapple
with neither of my guards without the
risk of being shot by the other; and to
be led out thus&mdash;I, an officer on parole, a
prisoner of war, protected by the promise
of the Duc de Broglie&mdash;led out to be
butchered by two unscrupulous ruffians,
and without a struggle&mdash;the thought was
too dreadful for contemplation.
</p>

<p>
But such was the intended sequel to
that night's adventures.
</p>

<p>
Halting close to a thicket about a mile
distant from the schloss, the irregular
outline of which was clearly defined
against the starry sky, the corporal told
me to "stand still, or march ten paces
forward, and then turn round."
</p>

<p>
"For what purpose?"
</p>

<p>
"You will soon see," replied Karsseboom,
as he slapped the butt of his musket
with cool significance, and proceeded to
kick, or scoop with his feet, a long trench
in the soft snow.
</p>

<p>
"You do not&mdash;you cannot mean to
butcher me here?" said I, following them
closely.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Halte là</i>!  Stand where you are," cried
the corporal, "or, <i>nom d'un Pape</i>!  I will
shoot you down with my muzzle at your
head.  <i>Ah, sacre!&mdash;canaille&mdash;Rosbif!</i>"
</p>

<p>
A wild beating of the heart; a dryness
of the lips, which I strove to moisten
with my tongue; a dull sense of stupor
and alarm, all soon to end, come over me,
when cocking their pieces they retired
backward close to the thicket.  After
carefully examining their priming, they
were in the act of raising the butts to
their shoulder to take aim, when thinking
that all was over with me in this world,
I strove to call to memory a prayer, and
something like a solemn invocation of
God was forming on my lips, when both
muskets exploded upwards in the air, and
their reports rung far away on the frosty
atmosphere, making me give an involuntary
and spasmodic leap nearly a yard
high.
</p>

<p>
I looked, and lo! there were my
corporal and his Teuton comrade lying
prostrate in the snow, while a man of great
stature, armed with a large cudgel, was
brandishing it above them, and kicking
them the while with uncommon vehemence
and vigour.
</p>

<p>
"Lie there, ye loons!" he exclaimed, in
a dialect I had little difficulty in
recognising even in that exciting moment;
"I have gi'en you a Liddesdale cloure,
and <i>you</i> a Lockerbie lick on the chaffets&mdash;ye
unco' vermin!"  Then he proceeded to
twirl his ponderous cudgel&mdash;a branch
recently torn from a tree&mdash;round his head
to dance among the snow and to sing&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Wha daur meddle wi' me?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wha daur meddle wi' me?<br />
  My name is wee Jock Elliot,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So wha daur meddle wi' me?"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
On advancing, I found to my astonishment
that my protector was my comrade,
Big Hob Elliot of the Scots Greys!

<p><a id="chap15"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
THE DEAD HUSSAR.
</h3>

<p>
"'Ods, sir, the hand o' Providence is in
this!" exclaimed Hob, capering among
the snow with renewed joy, but rather
clumsily in his heavy jack boots; "and
so you are the puir Redcoat thae devils
were gaun to butcher!"
</p>

<p>
"How came you here, Hob?" I inquired
in a somewhat agitated voice.
</p>

<p>
"How came you here, yourself, sir?
But we hae nae time for spiering; we'll
tak' their muskets and awa' to some place
o' safety."
</p>

<p>
In a trice Hob tumbled the French
corporal, who was just recovering, out of
his crossbelts, and appropriating his
cartridge-box, handed me one musket, while
arming himself with the other.  We then
hastened at a smart pace round the thicket,
leaving the two scoundrels, French and
German, to rouse them as best they could, or
to smother amid the snow, for Hob had
dealt each a stunning blow on the head.
</p>

<p>
As we hurried on, he told me briefly
and hastily that he and nine other Scots
Greys had been confined in a chamber of
the outworks of Ysembourg, where they
were packed as closely as ever Governor
Holwell's unfortunate companions were in
the Black Hole at Calcutta; but suffered
from extreme cold in place of heat.  It
occurred to one who had been a stonemason,
that the paved floor was hollow
underneath, so this suggested the idea of
attempting an escape.
</p>

<p>
Hob had been left with his spurs on
his heels, so with these he proceeded to
pick out the lime, and on raising a stone
slab a vaulted place was discovered below.
They resolved to explore it, and soon found
that it was a passage or gallery leading
to the dry ditch of the fortress, and
lighted by a row of loopholes meant for
enfilading by musketry the ditch itself.
</p>

<p>
Two of these loopholes were rapidly
beaten or torn into one by Hob's powerful
hands armed with a stone, and then the
whole party crawled through into the fosse
undiscovered, and just as day was breaking.
</p>

<p>
The snow, which was falling fast,
concealed all noise and kept the sentinels
within their boxes, so by expertly using
their hands and feet the fugitives crossed
the ditch and clambered up the opposite
side; but there a wooden stockade of
considerable height presented itself, and
while searching for an outlet they were
fired on by a sentinel from above, and at
the same moment encountered an officer
going his rounds with an escort of the
inlying picket.
</p>

<p>
An alarm was immediately given; a
scuffle, in which the escort opposed their
bayonets to the unarmed men, ensued,
and all were retaken save Hob Elliot,
whose vast strength and activity enabled
him to elude the levelled muskets, beat
down two or three of the escort, reach an
open wicket, and escape into the obscurity
of the snowy morning.  He had wandered
all the ensuing day without knowing
which way to turn, inspired only by the
hope of reaching the Lahn, but a skirmish
which had been going on between the
Light Dragoons of the allies and the
French Hussars had compelled him to
lurk in woods and thickets, as he feared
being shot at by both alike; for in his
present plight and after all he had
undergone, very little of poor Hob's red coat
remained, and of that the colour was
somewhat dubious.  Besides he was
worn out with fatigue, and now
nearly dead of cold, though his animal
spirits bore bravely up against danger
and adversity.
</p>

<p>
It was during this crisis in his affairs
that, while concealed in a clump of trees,
he had seen me conducted there by the
two hirelings of Bourgneuf, and but for
him, at their hands I had assuredly
perished by a miserable and unknown
death.
</p>

<p>
We had both narrowly escaped captivity
and danger; but I knew that three parties
were yet out in pursuit of me, and that
the ford was still guarded; so we were still
in a horrible dilemma.
</p>

<p>
Refreshment and a guide were
necessary; but where were we to find either?
Loading the captured muskets we trod
hopefully on, till we reached a cottage or
small farmhouse, which to all appearance
was deserted, as no smoke ascended from
the chimneys, no dog barked or cock
crew in the yard, the gate of which lay
open or flat upon the ground.
</p>

<p>
A skirmish between the French
Dragoons and the Prussian Black
Hussars had evidently taken place close
by this farm; for near it several horses,
still accoutred were lying dead among the
deep snow, and in some instances we saw
spurred boots and ghastly white hands
sticking up through it.
</p>

<p>
When we opened the door and entered
the lower apartment the reason of the
silence within it was at once accounted
for, and we saw that which at another
time, and to folks less case-hardened than
Hob and I, would have been a very
appalling spectacle.
</p>

<p>
The house had been pillaged and its
usual occupants had fled; but on the
table of the principal room lay a dead
body muffled in a scarlet cloak, all save
the feet (from which the boots had been
stolen), and stiffly white and cold they
protruded beyond the scarlet covering.
</p>

<p>
In a corner lay a pile of regimental
coats, caps, boots, shirts, stockings, waist
and shoulder-belts, all spotted, and in
some instances soaked with now frozen
blood; and there, too, were broken swords,
bent bayonets, and wooden canteens piled
up by those vile strippers of the dead,
who would no doubt return ere long for
their plunder, so this was no place for us
to linger in.
</p>

<p>
A Prussian Hussar, in the black uniform
laced with white of the King's favourite
regiment, lay in another corner almost
without a wound, yet quite dead, and in
a pool of his own blood.  A sword-point
had grazed his left temple, severing the
temporal artery, and he had bled to death,
thus his blanched aspect was ghastly in
the extreme.
</p>

<p>
"Horrible!" said I, shuddering.
</p>

<p>
"Maist deevilish!" added my companion,
"but I've kenned o' waur."
</p>

<p>
Urged I knew not by what motive, for
on service the emotion of mere <i>curiosity</i>
soon becomes extinct, I turned down the
mantle of the dead body which lay on the
table, and then imagine my regret and
horror on tracing in the glazed eyes, the
relaxed jaw, the livid but handsome face,
where the black moustache contrasted
with its pallor, the Chevalier de
Boisguiller, the gay and heedless Frenchman,
who now lay stiff and cold in his rich
Hussar uniform.  He had been shot
through the heart, and must have died
instantly, as there was not much blood
about him, but a fearful expression of
agony yet distorted his features.
</p>

<p>
Hob at once recognised him, and said,
</p>

<p>
"He was a braw cheild, this Boygilly;
but he has gane oot o' the world noo,
and I daursay the damned world will never
miss him."
</p>

<p>
The poor fellow's sabretache lay by him,
together with his braided and tasselled
Hussar pelisse and fur cap.  I opened the
former, and found it contained the two
despatches from the Duc de Broglie to
Maréchal de Contades, for which he had
waited at Ysembourg on the night I left
it&mdash;despatches now spotted by his own
blood.  They detailed some future
operations that were to take place on the
heights of Corbach, and enclosed Monjoy's
diagrams of parallels and approaches before
the castles of Marburg and Dillenburg,
and all of these I knew would prove of
inestimable value to our leader, Prince
Ferdinand of Brunswick.
</p>

<p>
I now conceived the idea of passing
myself off for my poor friend, whose
character on this side of the Lahn was
certainly a safer one than my own.  I threw
off my red coat, and put on his fur-trimmed
pelisse and Hussar cap, together with his
belt and sabretache, with its valuable
papers.
</p>

<p>
Grim through this masquerading, Hob
Elliot, who had been investigating several
cupboards, and overhauling some haversacks,
in which he found only a biscuit or
two, laughed with stentorian lungs when
he saw me attired in French uniform.
</p>

<p>
Then he presented me with a biscuit, saying,
</p>

<p>
"'Ods, sir, we maun e'en feed oursels in
this wilderness o' a place, for the ravens
are no' likely to do it."
</p>

<p>
To him I gave the scarlet cloak and a
suitable forage cap, and after vainly
searching the house for anything it might
contain in the shape of more food or
spirits, of which we stood much in need,
we set out about mid-day with a story
framed to suit any French party we might
meet in our wanderings.
</p>

<p>
I knew poor Boisguiller so well that I
could if necessary imitate his voice and
manner; and as we were much about the
same height and complexion, I had no
fear of passing myself off successfully for
the chevalier.  Yet, if discovered, we now
ran a terrible risk of being hanged or shot
as spies, or prisoners escaping, or it might
be for having slain the man whose uniform
I wore and whose papers I carried.
</p>

<p>
We met no one to guide us, while
proceeding in what we conceived, by the
gradual descent of the road and rivulets,
to be the direction of the Lahn, until just
as the dusk of the short winter eve was
closing in, we saw a party of six French
soldiers of the Line, muffled up in their
greatcoats, their muskets slung, their
three-cornered hats pulled well over their
faces, and their hands thrust in their
pockets for warmth, coming leisurely
towards us.
</p>

<p>
We had nothing for it now but to
advance boldly and meet them, and the
reader may conceive that my emotions
were far from soothing on finding myself
confronted by Arnaud de Pricorbin, and
the same men whom I had so recently
met at the ford.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
ARNAUD DE PRICORBIN.
</h3>

<p>
When about twenty paces distant they
halted, and as the evening was dusky
cast about their muskets.  Then Arnaud
cried with a loud voice,
</p>

<p>
"<i>Qui va là?</i>"
</p>

<p>
Hob Elliot very unwisely replied in his
native tongue, and bade him go to&mdash;it
was not Heaven.  On this Pricorbin
slapped the butt of his musket and
challenged again.
</p>

<p>
"<i>La France</i>," said I, in a very confident
tone, and still continuing to advance; "I
am the Chevalier de Boisguiller, going
towards Freyenthal on special service."
</p>

<p>
"Boisguiller of the Hussars de la
Reine?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Oui, mon camarade</i>," said I, with a
jaunty air.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bon Dieu</i>!  M. le Chevalier on foot?"
</p>

<p>
"My horse was shot in a skirmish yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Tais-toi, nous serrons entendus,
monsieur</i>," said Arnaud, in a subdued voice,
and presenting arms as I came close to
him.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Pourquoi?</i>" said I, with affected impatience.
</p>

<p>
"Because the King of Prussia's Black
Hussars are within musket shot of us."
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
"Among yonder trees," said all the
soldiers together in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
"It matters not to me," said I; "we go
under <i>cartel</i>."
</p>

<p>
I now perceived that one of the six
soldiers had his head and face tied up with
bloodstained handkerchiefs.
</p>

<p>
"And this big Gendarme?" inquired
Arnaud, pointing to Hob Elliot.
</p>

<p>
"My guide from Ysembourg."
</p>

<p>
"Had he better not return with us?
Monsieur is close to the ford."
</p>

<p>
Instead of replying to this uncomfortable
suggestion, I asked "Have you found
him you watched for?"
</p>

<p>
"The escaped prisoner?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Diable</i>&mdash;yes."
</p>

<p>
"No, monsieur," he replied, with a
malediction, in which the others, especially he
of the slashed visage, heartily joined,
while stamping their feet and blowing
their fingers; "and so, after being
half-frozen, we have left the ford in
despair."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;in yonder cottage on the slope
of the hill you will find him lying dead,
with his red coat beside him."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Tres bon!</i>&mdash;but I have some brandy
here, M. le Chevalier," said Arnaud,
presenting his canteen.
</p>

<p>
"<i>A votre santé, mon camarade</i>," said I,
drinking and handing the vessel to Hob,
who without the smallest compunction
and with a leer in his eye drained it to
the last drop.  "Diable! 'tis a cold
night&mdash;I shaved off my moustache to avoid
icicles; now, <i>camarade</i>, the direct road to
the ford?"
</p>

<p>
"Is this we are on, monsieur&mdash;a half-mile
further will bring you to it, but
beware of the Hussars."
</p>

<p>
The deception was complete, and
away they went double quick to the dreary
cottage on the hill.
</p>

<p>
Amid the darkness which had now set
in, we reached the willow bushes and
scattered rocks at the ford, the scene of
my late affair with its watchers, and there
a hoarse challenge in German rung through
the frosty air upon our right.  Then issuing
from a thicket of pines, we saw a patrol
of twenty of those dark and sombre
fellows, the King of Prussia's Death's-head
Hussars, riding slowly toward us.
</p>

<p>
They were all mounted (like our own
corps) upon grey horses, their uniform was
black, trimmed with silver or white braid,
and skulls and cross-bones grimly adorned
their caps, saddle-cloths and accoutrements,
It was commonly said that the Black
Hussars neither took nor gave quarter.
Of this I know not the truth; but under
the gallant and intrepid General Ziethen,
they gained a glorious reputation during
the Seven Years' War.
</p>

<p>
I speedily made myself known to the
officer in command.  He informed me
that my corps, which he knew well by its
reputation, and by the grey horses and
grenadier caps of their riders, had suddenly
left all the villages of the Lahn and
marched to Osnaburg (thirty-seven miles
from Minden) a town which Hob and I
reached, after undergoing no small degree
of suffering and privation, about the
beginning of January; and happy were
we when we saw the union-jack flying
above the fortress on the Petersburg, and
our sentinels in their familiar red coats at
the gates.
</p>

<p>
Then indeed did we feel at home, and
that night in Tom Kirkton's quarters
opposite the Dominican monastery, over
a smoking rasher of Westphalian bacon
and a crown bowl of steaming brandy
punch, I had the pleasure of relating to
old Colonel Preston and other
brother-officers all our adventures after my
fashionable friend Shirley had blown up
the bridge of the Lahn.
</p>

<p>
One of the first persons I inquired for
was this gallant major, who, however, was
elsewhere with the staff of Prince
Ferdinand of Brunswick; but I was determined
to settle my little score with him on the
first suitable occasion.  We had a jovial
reunion; many times was the punchbowl
replenished.  Tom Kirkton gave us his
favourite ditty, and then the old Colonel,
in a voice somewhat cracked, struck up&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Malbrook s'en va t'en guerre, (and)<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Mironton, Mironton, Mirontaine!</i>"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
chorussed all to the clank of glasses and
drinking-horns.
</p>

<p>
My indignation was great on finding
that not content with betraying me into
the hands of the enemy, Shirley, to blacken
my professional reputation, had forwarded
to the Marquis of Granby, General of our
cavalry, a report to the effect, that "by
culpable negligence Cornet Gauntlet had
delayed to recross the Lahn, and had
<i>permitted</i> himself to be taken prisoner,
thus <i>betraying</i> into the hands of the enemy
ten men and ten horses of his Majesty's
Scots Grey Dragoons."
</p>

<p>
The corps were so furious at this
aspersion that they cast lots for who should
call him out; it fell on a Captain named
Cunningham, who sent at once a challenge,
which the Major declined on the
prudent plea that "he could deal with
the principal only," but worthy old Colonel
Preston, who had seen the whole affair
from the tower of Freyenthal, cleared me
of all the imputations of Shirley, whom
I would have punished severely by horsewhip
and pistol, had he not been mortally
wounded in a skirmish on the 10th of
January, when he expired in the hands of
two soldiers who were carrying him to
the rear in his sash.
</p>

<p>
On the day after I reached Osnaburg,
Tom Kirkton, with a Scotch smirk in his
face, handed me a letter addressed in a
lady's small Italian hand.
</p>

<p>
It proved to be a kind one from my
cousin Aurora&mdash;"the little usurper," as I
named her; "the fair pretender," as she
was styled by Tom.
</p>

<p>
Well, thought I, amid the horrors of
war and the bitterness of such a wayward
passion as that I cherished for the French
girl, it <i>is</i> something above all price to
have a pure English heart to remember,
to pray for, and perhaps to love me, as
this dear Aurora does at home.
</p>

<p>
In a postscript she sent her "best duty
and kind regards to Major Shirley of the
Staff."
</p>

<p>
"Poor devil!" muttered Tom, who was
shaving himself for parade, and using the
back of his watch as a mirror.
</p>

<p>
Having nothing else in the shape of
uniform, I had to wear poor Boisguiller's
gay Hussar pelisse on parade and on duty
for some days, until our quartermaster
supplied me with a sergeant's coat (minus
its chevrons, of course), a trooper's sword,
pistols and accoutrements; and in this
motley guise I made my <i>début</i> as Lieutenant
of the Light Troop (and served in
it during the remainder of the campaign),
for so valuable were the despatches
regarding the projected movements of
the French on the heights of Corbach and
before the castles of Marburg and
Dillenburg, that for procuring them I had been
appointed to a Lieutenancy in the 2nd
Dragoon Guards by Prince Ferdinand,
and then gazetted back into my own
corps&mdash;the boys who were <i>second to none</i>,
and whom I had no desire to leave.
</p>

<p>
We moved soon after to Schledhausen.
There we remained until the month of
May, when we marched through a country
covered with forests to Fritzlar, a small
town which belonged to the Elector of
Mentz, where we were brigaded with the
11th Light Dragoons under General
Elliot till the month of June, when the
army again took the field.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
THE HEIGHTS OF CORBACH.
</h3>

<p>
The allied British and Germans under
Prince Ferdinand, though less numerous
than the troops under the Duc de Broglie,
were in fine fighting order, yet they
prudently acted chiefly on the defensive.
</p>

<p>
The Duc de Broglie having quarrelled
with the Comte de St. Germain who
commanded the army of the Rhine, generally
failed to act in concert with him, and thus
saved the Prince from the, perhaps fatal,
hazard of meeting their united strength
in another general action.  Prior to this
quarrel (which ultimately compelled the
Count to retire from the service) the French
arms had been very successful.
</p>

<p>
They had overrun the whole Landgraviate
of Hesse, with their grand army,
leaving troops to blockade the castles of
Marburg and Dillenburg, the operations
before which were successfully conducted
on the plans of Gervais Monjoy, while
St. Germain marched through Westphalia to
form a junction with the Maréchal Duc,
who, by the 10th of July, had encamped
on the heights of Corbach.
</p>

<p>
On hearing that his two castles had
fallen into the hands of the French, Prince
Ferdinand, whom the papers I had found
in the sabretache of Boisguiller had fully
informed of the intended movement
towards Corbach, commenced a retreat
from Fritzlar towards the river Dymel;
and sent his son, the Hereditary Prince,
with a strong detachment towards
Sachsenhausen where he meant to encamp.
Some British troops, horse and foot,
accompanied the young Prince on this
expedition, and of these our regiment
unluckily formed a part.
</p>

<p>
We continued to advance without
opposition until the 30th of the month, when
on coming in sight of the heights of
Corbach and the distant town of Ysembourg,
we found a body of French troops
formed in order of battle and barring
our march to Sachsenhausen.
</p>

<p>
Their strength seemed to be about ten
battalions and fifteen squadrons, so far as
we could judge at first.
</p>

<p>
"Now who or what the devil may these
be?" we asked of each other, when we
saw their arms shining in the sun, their
colours waving in the wind, and the long
line of white coats, three ranks deep,
appear on the green mountain slope,
where we had no idea of meeting any
troops at all.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said several, especially the staff
officers who were spurring to and fro, in
evident excitement; "'tis only the
vanguard of the Comte de St. Germain, whom
we must drive in."
</p>

<p>
The order was instantly given for
the infantry to attack, the cavalry to
support, and now began a brief but
sharp, and to us very fatal engagement.
</p>

<p>
It was the noon of a lovely summer day.
</p>

<p>
Near us the Itter was rolling a blue
flood between the green mountains, its
banks fringed by light waving willows
and dark wild laurels; beyond an opening
or pass in the mountains where some
French artillery were in position, we saw
a fair and fertile plain, dotted by poplar
trees, stretching far away in the sunlight,
and the quaint old town of Corbach, with
its ruddy walls and latticed windows that
glittered like plates of gold.
</p>

<p>
Our infantry began the affair with great
spirit, and none stood to their colours more
bravely than our 51st Foot, Brudenel's old
corps, which was led by a gallant soldier,
Lieutenant-Colonel Noel Fury.
</p>

<p>
The young Prince soon found that he
had made a reckless mistake, and was
engaged with the united strength of the
French army, and with no vanguard or
detached force, like his own!  It was too
late to recede, so madly we strove by
bayonet and sabre to hew a passage
towards Sachsenhausen, but strove in
vain, as De Broglie constantly poured
forward fresh supports; and although
the main body of the allies under old
Prince Ferdinand was but a few miles in
our rear, such was the nature of the
ground that they could yield us no
assistance whatever; so about two o'clock in
the afternoon the trumpets sounded from
right to left a retreat which it became
our duty to cover.
</p>

<p>
As we galloped in sections round the
flank of the 51st, and just as that
regiment began to fall back from its line of
dead and dying, I saw a dreadful episode,
caused by the French Artillery.
</p>

<p>
Thrown from a mortar, a cartouche fell
amid their ranks, and, by its explosion,
in a single moment killed and wounded
five officers and sixty rank and file!  For
the information of the non-military reader,
I may state that this deadly missile is a
case of wood about three inches thick at
the bottom, bound about with marline,
holding ten iron balls, each a pound in
weight, and four hundred musket-balls.
It had been fired from a howitzer on
the rocks above the pass, and by one
of this dreadful shower of balls the
young Prince was wounded in the
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
When the retreat began, several of the
German regiments fell into confusion, and
the French were not slow in taking
advantage of it.  The task of repelling
them fell upon the Scots Greys, with the
1st or King's and 3rd Dragoon Guards,
and with enthusiastic cheers we followed
the young Prince in a succession of
brilliant charges, which drove the enemy
back, enabling our unfortunate comrades
in the Infantry to make an almost
undisturbed retreat.  I say almost, for the
French, who continued the pursuit till
evening, brought up their Flying Artillery,
and in the dusk we could plainly see
the fiery arcs described by the shells,
which the field mortars threw nearly at
random to the distance of a thousand
yards.  So brightly burned the fuses,
that we could avoid the falling bombs
by scattering, dismounting, and throwing
ourselves flat, as their exploding splinters
always rise at an angle of several degrees
from the earth.
</p>

<p>
On this service, which saved our
Infantry from entire capture, few
officers distinguished themselves more
than Count Keilmansegge, Colonel Preston,
and Major Hill of our 1st Dragoon
Guards.
</p>

<p>
Our corps lost but one man, who, with
his horse, was killed by a single cannon
shot that passed between Sergeant Duff
and me.
</p>

<p>
By another, the colonel of the 51st was
slain.  I have elsewhere mentioned two
cases of presentiment, one of which was
fatally realized at the time, the other
afterwards.  The leader of the 51st was
inspired by a crushing emotion of this
kind on that day at Corbach, and as the
anecdote is little known, being related in
the long since forgotten memoirs of a
Scottish officer who served under him, I
may quote it here.
</p>

<p>
"My old Lieutenant-Colonel, Noel Fury,
was one of the slain.  It is said by some
that individuals may be visited by an
undefined presentiment or mental warning of
their approaching fate, though such ideas
are treated by others as visionary and
impossible.  I shall not attempt to enter
into a discussion which might lead me
into the mazes of metaphysical inquiry,
but shall content myself with a simple
narrative of what I witnessed on the
morning of this engagement.
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Fury was remarkable for the
liveliness and gaiety of his disposition,
and his spirits, on an occasion like the
present, when about to enter into action, were
uniformly observed to be unusually elevated.
His habitual sprightliness and
good humour made him a general favourite
in the regiment; besides, he was a man
of distinguished gallantry and an excellent
officer.  Among other good qualities, he
paid especial attention to the filling of his
canteen, and on the morning in question
he sat down under a tree, inviting several
of his brother officers to breakfast.
</p>

<p>
"For the <i>first time</i> in his life, on the eve
of an engagement, he seemed pensive and
dull, and on being rallied on the subject
by some of the gentlemen present&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'I don't know how it is,' he answered,
'but I think I shall be killed to-day.'
</p>

<p>
"The cannonade having just begun, he
mounted his horse, and rode up to the
regiment, where he had been but a very
short time when his head was carried off
by a cannon shot."
</p>

<p>
Our <i>total</i> loss was five hundred men,
and fifteen pieces of cannon.
</p>

<p>
We rejoined the main body of the allied
army full of rage and disgust at our
discomfiture, and clamouring for an
opportunity to encounter the foe again; nor
was it long before that opportunity
came.
</p>

<p>
Among the papers found in the sabretache
of Boisguiller, was one which
informed Prince Ferdinand of a proposed
movement of the French from Corbach
towards Ziegenheim, and on this point he
fixed his attention.
</p>

<p>
Not many days after our last affair,
tidings came that a body of the French,
commanded by Major General Glaubitz
and Colonel Count Bourgneuf, had
advanced in that direction.
</p>

<p>
Immediately on hearing this, our leader
directed the young hereditary prince,
who was eager and burning to wipe out
the late disgrace, to drive them back, and
on this service he departed, with six
battalions of Hussars, the Scots Greys,
11th Light Dragoons, Luckner's Hussars,
and two brigades of Chasseurs.
</p>

<p>
In high spirits and full of ardour we
marched on the 16th of July, came
suddenly upon the enemy at Emsdorff,
attacked them with great fury, slew a great
number of all ranks, took the Major-General,
all the artillery and baggage,
one hundred and twenty-seven officers
and two thousand two hundred soldiers
prisoners.
</p>

<p>
Count Bourgneuf, however, contrived
to make his escape, after a rough
hand-to-hand combat with Captain Cunningham
of the Greys.
</p>

<p>
In this action, our 11th Light Dragoons,
popularly known as Elliot's Horse, charged
no less than <i>five</i> times, and broke through
the enemy at every charge; but in these
achievements they lost a great number of
officers, men, and horses.  Here for the
first time we found ourselves opposed to a
corps of Lancers, whose weapon was then
unknown in our army.  When Preston
led us to the charge against them, their
tall lances, with red pennons streaming,
were erect; but when we were within
three horses' length of them, a trumpet
sounded, then they lowered them all
breast-high and waved their streamers, so
that many of our horses shied wildly;
but we broke through them, nevertheless,
and the spear-heads once passed, all was
over with the Lancers.
</p>

<p>
On the 22nd of August, when we attacked
the French rearguard at Zierenberg,
as it was commanded by Bourgneuf, and
consisted of the regiments of Bretagne and
Clermont, I hoped for an opportunity of
meeting my personal enemy, but was
disappointed; for although we burst into
the town, which is surrounded by a wall and
has three gates, and in columns of troops
charged into the heart of the disordered
French, cutting them down right and
left, I never saw the Count, though, amid
the fury and confusion of such a conflict,
I must have been more than once within
pistol-shot of him.
</p>

<p>
Here we had five men and nine horses
killed, Colonel Preston and twenty men
wounded; but now came the affair which,
was known in the army as the battle of
Zierenberg, where I had once again an
opportunity of meeting my unscrupulous
Frenchman face to face.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><br />
A NIGHT ATTACK.
</h3>

<p>
We were encamped at Warburg, when, in
September, we received orders to hold
ourselves in readiness to move on particular
service, and at an hour's notice&mdash;a troublesome
communication, for we could scarcely
unharness by day or by night, and had to
keep our horses almost constantly saddled.
At last came instructions to march, about
nightfall, on a dull and gloomy evening,
the 5th of September, when, with two
regiments of foot (Maxwell's and the famous
old 20th), the Inniskilling, and Bock's
Hanoverian Dragoons, Bulow's Jagers,
and one hundred and fifty Highlanders,
we left the camp with all our tents standing
to make a night attack upon the town of
Zierenberg, which had been reinforced,
and where Bourgneuf still commanded.
</p>

<p>
The forces there consisted of the
Volontaires de Clermont and the regiments of
Dauphiné and Bretagne&mdash;in all about
three thousand men.  Luckily, we were
furnished with the password for the 5th
September&mdash;<i>Artois</i>; it had been brought
over by a deserter, who proved to be no
other than the rascal Arnaud de Pricorbin,
who had come into Warburg about noon,
and thus betrayed his comrades, who
passed their time almost careless of
security, and having but slender guards
and outposts.
</p>

<p>
The town, he informed us, was still a
place of no strength; and, though
surrounded by a dry ditch, that was shallow,
and the wall within it was crumbling with
age and decay.
</p>

<p>
Led by Colonel Preston, the Scots Greys
were to head the attack.
</p>

<p>
As we marched, the dark and obscurity
of the autumn evening deepened on the
scenery.  The duty was an exciting one,
for the whole French army was encamped
at a short distance from the point of attack,
and we knew not the moment when we
might find ourselves in a snare or ambush;
for the story of the deserter, as to the
password, the real strength of the force
under Bourgneuf, and his dispositions for
defence, might all be a lure, though the
fellow remained in the hands of our
quarter-guard as a hostage for the truth
of his statements.
</p>

<p>
We crossed the river Dymel near the
Hanse Town of Warburg, and saw the
brown chesnut-groves that border its
banks, the clear stars, and the crescent of
the waning moon reflected in its current.
</p>

<p>
Ere long we saw the lights in Zierenberg
and the fires of the French, whole
companies of whom were bivouacked in the
streets of the little town, where they made
fuel of the furniture, the rafters, and floors
of such houses as shot or shell had
previously made too ruinous for occupation.
</p>

<p>
When within two miles of the place,
the grenadiers of Maxwell, the 20th
Regiment, and the little band of Highlanders,
made a detour, taking three separate
routes, while we, the cavalry, took a
fourth, thus completely surrounding and
cutting off those who were cantoned in
Zierenberg.
</p>

<p>
According to Pricorbin's information,
which proved to be correct, a regiment of
French dragoons were bivouacked outside
the town wall and in front of the principal
gate; and it was with them <i>we</i> had first
to deal.  We continued to advance in
silence, all orders being passed in whispers,
and thus not a sound broke the stillness
of the night, but the monotonous tramp of
our horses' hoofs, the occasional rattle of
our accoutrements, the clatter of a steel
scabbard or a chain bridle, till, unluckily,
some of our horses began to neigh, and
we could distinctly hear some of the
French chargers responding, for the air
was calm, still, and clear.
</p>

<p>
"Push on&mdash;push on!" was now said by
all; "the alarm is given, and we have no
time to lose!"
</p>

<p>
The moon, which occasionally gave out
weird gleams of silver light between the
masses of dark cloud that floated slowly
on the upper currents of air, was now
luckily enveloped, and all the scenery
was intensely dark.  Yet we could
distinctly see the lights twinkling in the
town, and the glare of the night fires,
which cast flashes of lurid and wavering
radiance upon the steep gables, the spire
of a church, and the undefined outlines
of masses of building.  The French could
see nothing of us; but the neighing of
our nags was sufficient to give them all
an <i>alerte</i>, consequently, when we came
within four hundred yards of the town
gate, the whole regiment of horse were
in their saddles to receive whatever might
be approaching.
</p>

<p>
We were advancing in close column
of troops as the way was broad and open.
The Inniskillings were in our rear; the
light troop of ours was in front of the
whole, with Colonel Preston riding
between Douglas and me.
</p>

<p>
On the roadway, as we approached, we
could see the black figure of a single
horseman posted.
</p>

<p>
"When he challenges, Gauntlet, reply
in French," whispered the Colonel; "say
something to deceive him."
</p>

<p>
Preston had scarcely spoken, when the
voice of the vidette rung out clearly on
the night&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Qui vive?</i>"
</p>

<p>
"Artois," I replied, while we all pressed
forward at a trot.
</p>

<p>
"<i>A quel regiment?</i>" shouted the vidette,
in great haste.
</p>

<p>
"Les Hussards de la Reine," said I,
giving the name of Boisguiller's
well-known corps, which was in the camp at
Corbach.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Très bien!</i> replied the soldier, but
the next moment he could hear Preston's
words of command, given sternly and low&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Prepare to charge&mdash;<i>charge!</i>"
</p>

<p>
The Frenchman's carbine flashed redly
through the gloom, almost in our faces;
the bullet whistled over our heads to the
rear, where a fearful cry told that it had
found a fatal billet among the Inniskillings;
then wheeling round his horse,
he galloped to the rear, where his
comrades were formed in column of
squadrons.
</p>

<p>
Ere the echoes of his shot had died
away on the night wind, we heard the
cheers of the 20th and the sound of the
Highland bagpipe mingling with the
hoarse hurrah of Bulow's light troop, as
the town was assailed on three other
points at once.  Then the opening
musketry flashed redly in various quarters,
and the gleam of sudden fires shot upward
in the murky air.
</p>

<p>
Sword in hand we burst, with the weight
and fury of a landslip, among the French
cavalry, and drove them back, not so much
by dint of edge or point, as by the sheer
weight of our men and horses.  So sudden
was the shock, so irresistible our charge,
that they scarcely made any resistance,
but were thrust pell-mell into the town,
in the narrow streets of which they were
so intermingled with our men and the
Inniskillings that in many instances
neither of us could use our swords.  For
some minutes, at this crisis, I found
myself completely isolated and wedged among
the French, some of whom actually laughed
at the whole affair.
</p>

<p>
Captain Cunninghame, of our first
troop, in consequence of a blow which
had penetrated the back of his grenadier
cap, fell backward on his horse's crupper
insensible, but could fall no further so
dense was the living press around him;
and thus he remained until the place
surrendered.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Preston, whose horse was
possessed of great spirit and fire, pressed
far beyond any of us; but before he
could reach the town-gate, it sprang
over the bridge with him into the ditch&mdash;where
the brave old boy remained up to
his thighs in mud, swearing and sputtering,
but in safety, until we extricated him
about daybreak.
</p>

<p>
Some of the houses being set on fire
lit up by their lurid glare the horrors of
the night attack.  Taken completely by
surprise, many of the French were fighting
in their shirts and breeches, and were
mingled in wild mêlée with the 20th and
Highlanders, using their bayonets and
clubbed muskets, without time to load or
fire, so closely were they wedged together;
but some who were in the houses opened
an indiscriminate fusilade on friends and
foes.  This so greatly exasperated the
nimble Highlanders, that in several
instances they stormed these mansions,
and with dirk and claymore slew without
mercy all within.
</p>

<p>
Every inch of ground was disputed by
death and blood.  The yells, cries, and
hurrahs of the opposing combatants
mingled with the clash of weapons that
glittered in the fires around them&mdash;fires
that reddened all the air; but the shouts
of the French grew weaker as the cheers of
the British increased.
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah lor the Inniskillings!" cried we.
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah for the Scots Greys!" cried
the Irish.
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah for Bulow's wild Jagers!"
cried both regiments.
</p>

<p>
A French officer, minus hat, wig, and
coat, was dragged roughly out of a house
by two furious Celts, who were jabbering
and swearing in their native Gaelic, as
if they had not made up their minds
whether to kill or capture him, when he
clung to my stirrup-leather, and without
attempting to use the sword in his hand,
breathlessly implored quarter.
</p>

<p>
I regarded his pale face with sudden
and stern interest, for this despairing
suppliant was the commandant of the
town, the Comte de Bourgneuf.
</p>

<p>
I lost no time in disarming him, by
snapping <i>his</i> sword across my saddle-bow,
contemptuously as he had snapped mine,
and desired the Highlanders to keep him
prisoner.  He was dragged away, and I
never saw him again.  It was enough;
he had <i>recognised me</i>!
</p>

<p>
His whole force, being completely
surrounded and hemmed in, capitulated, but
so many had perished in the attack that
we brought off only forty officers and four
hundred rank and file, with the colours of
the regiments of Dauphiné and Bretagne,
one of which I captured in the count's
quarters.  These trophies we lodged in
the camp at Warburg, after losing but few
men in the whole affair.
</p>

<p>
It was on that night's duty that
I <i>last</i> saw powder burned in the Seven
Years' War.
</p>

<p>
Our infantry were encamped under
canvas in the immediate vicinity of
Warburg, the quaint old German streets of
which presented a lively picture of
campaigning life, for every house had been
converted into a barrack; soldiers in
British or Hanoverian uniforms appeared
at all the windows, lounging, laughing,
and smoking, or pipeclaying their belts
or gaiters.  Piles of muskets stood in long
rows upon the pavements.  Here and
there a sentinel trod to and fro upon his
post, indicating the quarters of a colonel
or where the colours of a regiment were
lodged.
</p>

<p>
In the church were stalled our horses,
and there stable duty and religious
service went on together; for, as wounded
men died every day in our hands,
one seldom passed without a body being
laid before the altar muffled in a cloak,
greatcoat, or rug, prior to interment in the
trench outside the gates.
</p>

<p>
After our return from the night attack
at Zierenberg, I slept profoundly on the
bare floor of my billet, which was in an
empty house.  I think one does generally
sleep sound after enduring great excitement
or great calamity, for it is the <i>waking</i>
alone that brings back the sense of grief
or danger.  Prior to that came dreams,
and again I seemed to hear the bayonet
and sabre clashing, the shouts and the
wild work of last night: but from these
I was roused about raid-day by Tom
Kirkton, our adjutant, who as yet was
still accoutred.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Gauntlet, old friend," said he,
with a peculiar smile; "so you and I are
to part at last?"
</p>

<p>
"How&mdash;what do you mean, Tom?"
</p>

<p>
"You have been chosen by the
Commander-in-chief, on Colonel Preston's
recommendation (a dear old fellow, isn't
he?) to convey to London, and to the
king's own hand, his despatches and the
colours taken last night; and his orders
say, you must start in an hour."
</p>

<p>
"And I am to proceed&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"By our rear.  See, here is your route;
by Arensburg to Wesel, and thence down
the Rhine to Nimeguen on the Waal;
thence by boat to the mouth of the West
Scheldt, where some of our gun-brigs are
sure to be lying."
</p>

<p>
"Zounds!  Tom&mdash;a long and tiresome
journey; alone too! and the money?"
</p>

<p>
"Old Blount, the Paymaster-General,
furnishes that.  So come, rouse thee, friend
Basil&mdash;let us have a parting glass ere
you go, my dear boy."
</p>

<p>
There was an unmistakeable moisture
and sad expression in Tom's clear and
usually merry eye as he spoke, for we had
ever been the best of friends and comrades.
</p>

<p>
Within an hour after this I had packed
my valise, secured the French colours and
the Prince's despatches in a large
saddlebag&mdash;had bade adieu to our good old
colonel,* to Tom Kirkton, Douglas, and
others, and departed with sincere regret.
Hob Elliot and many of the Greys&mdash;braver
good, honest fellows&mdash;accompanied me to
the town gate, and the farewell cheer
they gave me as I passed through the
Infantry camp rings yet in my ear and
in my heart, as it did then when I waved
my cap, and said "God bless you!"
</p>

CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><br />
IN LONDON AGAIN,
</h3>

<p>
Before I reached England, some changes
had taken place of which we had as yet
heard nothing in our camps and
cantonments in Germany.
</p>

<p>
The king had died in October; his
grandson had been proclaimed by the
title of George III., and already the
Court was out of mourning, for the new
monarch had succeeded a father who had
been hated by the late king, and whom
<i>he</i> was never known to name or to speak
of during the whole of his long life; no
one knows <i>why</i>, but so it is, that the
memory of Frederick Lewis, Prince of
Wales, was speedily committed to oblivion.
</p>

<p>
After a narrow escape from a French
privateer, I was landed by a returned
transport at Portsmouth, and travelled
post to the English metropolis, halting
for a night at the Red Lion at Guildford,
where the landlord perfectly remembered
the affair of the highwayman in the
chimney, and insisted on my sharing with
him a crown bowl of punch in the good
old fashion, while I fought all my battles
over again.
</p>

<p>
Next evening, without encountering a
breakdown of the ricketty vehicle, an
overturn on the wretched roads, a masked
highwayman, or other adventure, I saw
before me mighty London, with the
double domes and peristyles of Greenwich
shining in the sun, and the old battered
fellows who had fought under Anson,
Hawke, and Boscawen enjoying their
pipes on the terrace; then the glorious
Thames, with its myriad shipping, and
the flags of all the world (France excepted)
flying over them; the vast façade of
St. Paul's&mdash;the great square mass of the
Tower, which made me think of the
jewels, the crown, the chains and
dungeons of tyrants long since gone to their
account, and of that long line of Norman
and English kings whom we may still
see there, with their wax faces and dusty
armour, ranged rank and file in the
Armoury.
</p>

<p>
Anon I was amid the roar and bustle
of Fleet-street and the Strand, and
had passed under Temple Bar, whereon
were still, white, bleached, and bare,
the skulls of those who perished for
principle and their king, though the
brothers of some of them led the ranks
of our Scottish corps at Minden.
</p>

<p>
I put up at the King George in Pall
Mall, where, for the first night for many,
many months, I could take mine ease in
mine inn, and where from the windows
I could see the flaring links and
flambeaux, the sedans and coaches, of those
who were proceeding to the theatres,
opera, balls, or elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
I thought of the time when I had been
last in London, under such different
circumstances&mdash;when I had come with the
despatch concerning the French spies&mdash;I,
a simple orderly dragoon&mdash;concerning
that wretch Hautois, before we sailed
from Portsmouth for Brittany, and
ages seemed to have elapsed since then.
</p>

<p>
After all I had seen of war, I agreed to
the full with my Lord Clarendon, in all
his views and remarks on the virtues and
blessings of peace.
</p>

<p>
At the George I felt myself apparently
amid lavish luxury!  Yet even carpets
were almost unknown in English
bedrooms during the early part of George
III.'s reign; but it seemed to me
that a comfortable home, a blazing
sea-coal fire, soft hearthrugs, warm curtains,
a smoking dinner and singing tea-urn,
a pretty English wife, with her true
domestic love (and a most becoming dress
of course), to do the honours of one's
house and table, a tranquil life, and all
that kind of thing, were a thousand times
better than pipeclay and glory, after all;
better than turning out by drumbeat or
bugle-call in a dark rainy morning, to
march fasting, to shoot or be shot at;
better than to hear the winter sleet
rattling on the wet tent, or to endure it
in the wetter bivouac; and so indeed
thought I, Basil Gauntlet, when on that
night of December I tucked myself
cosily in a warm bed at the George in
Pall Mall, and went off to sleep, with
the "drowsy hum" of London in my
ears.
</p>

<p>
Next day I presented my credentials at
the Horse Guards, obtained six months'
leave of absence, and was informed that
there would be a royal drawing-room at
Kensington Palace in two days after; and
the commander-in-chief kindly added
that he would arrange for my presentation
by his Grace the Duke of Argyle,
who was full colonel of my own Regiment,
and was then in town.  So, for two
days I was free to roam about the streets
in search of amusement.
</p>

<p>
Ignorant of London, I stumbled first
into the wooden house in Marylebonefields,
and saw a couple of sword-players
slashing each other with rapiers on a
platform to the sound of French horns
and a tenor drum; then followed a game
at quarterstaff, while the boxes and
galleries were crowded by men of the first
position, betting-book in hand, sword at
side, and the hat cocked knowingly over
the right eye.  From these I rambled to
Don Saltero's Museum, to see his stuffed
rhinoceroses, tigers, and monsters; thence
to an auction in Cornhill, where, among
other effects of a bankrupt shipbroker, a
young negro woman was put up to sale,
and bought by a Newmarket gentleman
for 32<i>l</i>.
</p>

<p>
As a soldier I could not resist going to
see the home battalions of the Foot Guards
exercised at the King's Mews, near
Charing Cross.  Then I dined at a
chocolate-house, summoned a chair, and was swung
off at a trot to the opera, where I heard
one of Mr. Handel's performances hissed
down, as quite unequal to the "Beggar's
Opera."
</p>

<p>
Next day I found a card waiting me at
my hotel.  The Duke expected me to
dine with him on that day, if not
otherwise engaged.
</p>

<p>
I found his Grace and the Duchess
waiting to receive me with great kindness
and affability.
</p>

<p>
He was John Campbell of Mamore,
who had lately succeeded to the dukedom,
after long service in Flanders and
Germany; he was now a Lieutenant-general,
Governor of Limerick, and a Scottish
representative Peer; she was Mary,
daughter of John, Lord Bellenden of
Auchinoule, a handsome and stately
woman, but now well up in years.
</p>

<p>
He asked me many questions about the
regiment, and inquired if "auld Geordie
Preston still adhered to his buff coat."  He
also made a few queries, but with
reserve, about the Cavalry movements at
Minden, and the charges brought against
Lord George Sackville.  On such matters
the gentle Duchess was silent; moreover,
she always shrunk from military matters,
as she had never recovered the loss of her
second son, Lord Henry Campbell, who
had been killed at the battle of Lafeldt.
</p>

<p>
Perceiving how threadbare my fighting-jacket
was&mdash;(it was the sergeant's coat I
had procured at Osnaburg)&mdash;I proposed
to get a court dress, or a new suit of
regimentals for the presentation to-morrow.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, nay," said the Duke; "come as
you are&mdash;we shall drive to the Palace in
my coach, and believe me, the ladies will
like you all the better in your purple coat.
It looks like work&mdash;zounds! yes.  And,
by-the-by, if you want any franks for the
North, or to hear a debate in the Upper
House, don't forget to command me."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap20"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br /><br />
THE DRAWING-ROOM.
</h3>

<p>
A presentation at Court may be a very
exciting thing to those who are unused
to such scenes; but to me, nothing
whatever could prove a source of excitement
yet, for no man is more self-possessed,
less interested in a mere spectacle, or in
whom the feeling of curiosity is so dead,
for a time at least, as one who has served
a campaign or two.
</p>

<p>
During the reign of the late king and
the early part of his successor's,
drawing-rooms occurred very frequently, and
royalty presented itself to the nobility
and gentry at least twice weekly; but
from various circumstances&mdash;perhaps the
recent mourning, so hastily laid
aside&mdash;on this occasion the attendance was
unusually great, and when the carriage of
the Duke, who wore the uniform of Colonel
of the Greys, with the star and dark green
ribbon of the Thistle, reached Kensington
Palace-gate, we found it quite blocked up
by brilliant equipages, sedan chairs, and
livery servants, having huge cocked hats,
long canes, and in some instances bouquets
of artificial flowers.
</p>

<p>
From the portico of the Palace to the
presence chamber, the Yeomen of the
Guard, under Viscount Torrington, and
the Gentlemen Pensioners, under the
Lord Berkeley of Stratton, lined all the
corridors and guarded the entrances, their
showy uniforms contrasting powerfully
with my patched and war-worn suit of
harness, which, sooth to say, seemed odd
enough, for my silver epaulettes were
reduced to mere tufts of black wire; my
once crimson sash to dingy fritters, my
jack-boots were of no particular tint, and
my spurs, like my scabbard, were a mass
of rust.
</p>

<p>
But I carried over my left arm the
standards of the regiments of Dauphiné
and Bretagne; and they secured me some
interest, in the eyes of the ladies at
least&mdash;the beauty and fashion of the first court
in the world&mdash;as they thronged past, in
hoops and brocades, their fine hair dredged
with powder, and their soft cheeks
obscured by rouge and patches.
</p>

<p>
My grandfather had disinherited me;
true!  I had nothing in the world but my
sword and my wretched pay as a sub; I
was not the Lord of Netherwood, moor
and hill, hall and river; but I was Basil
Gauntlet, of Minden and Zierenberg&mdash;and
they, at least, were something to be
heir to.
</p>

<p>
As we entered the gallery which leads
to the black marble staircase, two
gentlemen, one of whom was dressed in scarlet
richly embroidered with gold, and who
wore a very full perriwig&mdash;the other, who
was attired in a purple velvet suit corded
with silver, and who had on a sword of
unusual length, and a bag wig, entered
into conversation with the Duke, who
presented me to them as an officer of his
regiment.
</p>

<p>
The first was the groom of the stole,
the famous Earl of Bute, the future
premier, the foe of Wilkes and the
London mob; the other was my Lord
Huntingdon, Master of the Horse, and both
were pleased to say many handsome things
concerning our regiment and its services
during the war.  Moreover, the Lord
Bute was pleased to manifest his friendship
for me, by presenting his snuff-box
of light-blue sevres china, which he always
carried in the flap-pocket of his waistcoat.
</p>

<p>
The heat and crowd were great; many
had already been presented, and some were
withdrawing as we passed slowly through
several rooms of the old summer palace,
the walls of which were hung with rich
tapestry and ornamented by many pictures
and busts on pedestals.  Among others,
my Lord Bute and his Grace pointed out
to me the Venus of Titian and the Infant
Saviour by Rubens, the dark Holbeins,
some works of Albert Durer, and the
full-lengths of Orange William and Mary
Stuart, his queen&mdash;the former all nose
and white wig, the latter with a mass of
frizzled locks and a very bare bosom; and
so, by gently pressing onward, we found
ourselves in the presence-chamber, amid
all the glitter and splendour of the
court.
</p>

<p>
At the further end, on a chair of state
under a rich canopy of crimson velvet,
heavily laced, sat a fair-complexioned and
smooth-faced young man, of a mild but
most undignified and somewhat flabby
aspect, who wore the uniform of the Foot
Guards, with the magnificent collar and
order of the Garter sparkling on his breast,
and who had his powdered hair brushed
back, queued, and simply tied with a black
ribbon.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis the king!" whispered the Duke
of Argyle and my Lord Bute at the same
time.
</p>

<p>
I had never been in a palace or stood
in such a presence before, and, until now,
had been more occupied by the beauty of
the ladies and the splendour of their
jewels and dresses; but I felt a strange
thrill in my heart&mdash;<i>blasé</i> as it was by
the excitement of campaigning&mdash;when I
looked on the mild face of this same young
king, who was then in his twenty-third
year, who had a threefold ball and treble
sceptre to wield, and who had declared it
to be his proudest boast that he was
the FIRST of his race who had drawn
breath on British soil, and that he gloried
in it!
</p>

<p>
Many presentations went forward before
it came to my turn.  I saw Carolina,
Countess of Ancrum, a stately woman, in
a dress of white satin, superbly spangled
with gold, and drawn up in festoons by
cords of gold, to display an under-petticoat
of scarlet velvet, studded with seed-pearls,
advance towards the throne.  Her
hair was powdered white as snow, and tied
over a cushion about five inches high.
With a low courtesy she was presenting
to his majesty, who bowed graciously, a
very graceful girl, whose back, unfortunately,
was towards us; but I could admire
the wonderful fairness of her neck
and shoulders, over which some heavy
ringlets fell from the high cushion or pad,
above which her golden hair, all
undisguised by powder, was dressed and tied
with knots of scarlet ribbon.  Her dress
was of scarlet and white striped satin,
embroidered with gold on all the seams,
and as they withdrew, courtesying backward&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Gauntlet, 'tis our turn now," said the
Duke, while he took me by the left hand
and led me forward to the steps of the
throne, which were covered with crimson
cloth.
</p>

<p>
"Permit me," said he, "to present to
your majesty Sir Basil Gauntlet, of my
regiment, the 2nd Dragoons&mdash;an officer
who, by his personal bravery, has
contributed not a little to maintain their old
historic character of being <i>Second to None</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Good!&mdash;second to none&mdash;good, very
good!" said the young king, bowing very
pleasantly, and presenting his hand, which
I suppose I was expected to kiss; but
which, in my ignorance, I shook very
cordially, to the amusement of many fine
lords and macaronies who stood by.  I
coloured, but said confidently&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Commissioned by his Serene Highness
Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, General
of the allies, I have been sent from
our camp at Warburg in Westphalia, to
lay at your majesty's feet these trophies,
the standards of the regiments of Dauphiné
and Bretagne, captured in our late attack
on Zierenberg."
</p>

<p>
From my hands the king took the
colours, which were of blue silk, with the
royal crown and cypher of France.  One
bore the silver fleurs-de-lys; the other the
golden dolphin of Dauphiné in a field
ermine, and both exhibited the holes where
many a bullet had passed.  He thanked
me in a very handsome manner, while all
the brilliant groups which crowded that
magnificent apartment drew near to
observe and to listen.
</p>

<p>
Something of my story, perhaps of my
early misfortunes, my unmerited wrong,
and my enlistment, with a hundred fables
tacked thereto, had been buzzed or
whispered about; thus I found many bright
eyes and well-powdered personages in
fashionable pasteboard skirts regarding
me with well-bred interest.
</p>

<p>
"Good!" said the king, whose eloquence
seldom overflowed; "this is very good,
and your services shall be duly appreciated.
Did you serve at Minden?"
</p>

<p>
"I had the honour."
</p>

<p>
"In the cavalry?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sire&mdash;in the Scots Greys."
</p>

<p>
At those words, a gentleman in a
brigadier wig and suit of grey, corded with
silver, turned abruptly and surveyed me
with a louring eye.  He was no other
than my Lord George Sackville, who
hated the Scots&mdash;as he afterwards did the
Americans&mdash;because ten of the sixteen
generals who found him guilty of
misconduct at Minden were born north of the
Tweed; and so blindly did he hate that
portion of Britain, that for a time he was
universally believed to be the author of
"Junius' Letters;" thus, at the mention
of the Greys, 'tis no wonder that he started
as if a wasp had stung him.
</p>

<p>
The king gave the standards to my
Lord Huntingdon, and bowed to us again,
as we now withdrew to make way for others.
In retiring, I then perceived near the
throne one who had good reason to
remember with gratitude and respect the
uniform of a Scots Grey, the little Prince
Edward Augustus, Duke of York, whom
Jack Charters had saved from drowning
when the man-o'-war's boat was smashed
by a cannon shot near Querqueville Point
at Cherbourg.
</p>

<p>
I was mentioning this episode to the
Duke of Argyle, who felt an interest in
everything that related to his regiment,
when suddenly a charming voice said,
"Basil!" in my ear, a hand was laid softly
and timidly on my arm, two smiling blue
eyes looked calmly into mine, and I found
before me the fair girl, she with the
golden-hair, the scarlet-striped dress and
blue crape petticoat&mdash;my cousin, Aurora!
</p>

<p>
She now presented me to her chaperone,
the Countess of Ancrum, who had been
Lady Caroline d'Arcy, only daughter of
the Earl of Holderness.  She in turn
presented me to several ladies, who plied
me with the usual simple and silly
questions about the war and certain officers
who were serving with the army, until
Aurora passed her arm through mine and
we began to converse about ourselves.
</p>

<p>
Aurora was indeed very beautiful, and
when I looked on her delicate skin and
brilliant English complexion, "how,"
thought I, "could I ever admire a dark
Frenchwoman, or any but a blue-eyed girl!"
</p>

<p>
"I was so proud when I saw you led
forward to the king!" said Aurora,
"and to see you looking so well and
gallant, Basil.  Do you know that all
the ladies here quite envy my cousinship?"
</p>

<p>
"Aurora, how you flatter!  One would
think that you had been among the
French and not I."
</p>

<p>
"And what think you of the young king?"
</p>

<p>
"I am charmed by his condescension."
</p>

<p>
"Yet scandal says he is married to a
pretty quakeress named Hannah Lightfoot,
though about to espouse the Princess
of Mecklenburg-Strelitz," whispered
Aurora.  "What think you of that forsooth?"
</p>

<p>
"I wish you would not say such things,
cousin."
</p>

<p>
"Your loyalty is shocked, is it?  Well,
I shall not whisper treason, even in your
ear," replied Aurora, who proceeded to
point out several persons to me, and to
make remarks on them that were witty
enough at times.
</p>

<p>
"Who is that tall man with the blue
ribbon?"
</p>

<p>
"He with the military stride, who
seems to go right, left&mdash;right, left, head
up, and queue straight?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said I, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"That is the gallant old Earl of Crawford,
who led the Scottish Horse Guards
in Flanders."
</p>

<p>
"And that dapper little man in the
orange-coloured suit, whom he is now
presenting?"
</p>

<p>
"The Chevalier Chassegras de Lery,
the <i>first</i> of his Majesty's new Canadian
subjects that has appeared in London,
where, I can assure you, he is greatly
run after.  He was wounded in the siege
of Quebec, and assisted to bury the
Marquis of Montcalm.  But look you, cousin,
look!" continued Aurora, laughing and
blushing behind her large scarlet fan;
"do you see that grim-looking old
gentlewoman in green brocade?"
</p>

<p>
"Whom a bishop is presenting&mdash;yes."
</p>

<p>
"The late king died in her arms.  She
is the Countess of Yarmouth."
</p>

<p>
"Sophia de Walmoden!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Listen!&mdash;she is returning
thanks for her pension of 4000<i>l</i>. per
annum, for services rendered to his
Majesty's royal grandfather.  For all
his victories over the French the brave
Sir Edward Hawke gets exactly <i>half</i> that
sum."
</p>

<p>
With some interest I surveyed this old
personage in paint, patches, and brocade;
she who had wrought poor Charters such
mischief in his youth when he was about
eighteen, and she perhaps six and thirty.
</p>

<p>
But now the dusk was setting in; I
missed his grace of Argyle, or perhaps he
thought his duty to me ended at the foot
of the throne, and it was an odd coincidence
that Aurora also lost her chaperone,
Lady Ancrum; thus I had to escort her to
the Palace-gate.
</p>

<p>
"You must come to Netherwood for
the shooting, Basil," said she, as we
traversed the long corridors of the palace;
"at the Hall I keep a strange souvenir
of you," she continued, laughing&mdash;"an
old blunderbuss&mdash;do you remember it?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"You cannot have forgotten that night
on Wandsworth Common, and the old
blunderbuss which so terrified John Trot?"
</p>

<p>
"How could I forget the first time I
met you, Aurora!&mdash;but here is your chair."
</p>

<p>
Two yeomen of the guard made way
for us with their partisans; John Trot
was in attendance with cane and link, as
I handed Aurora into her sedan,
hooped-petticoat, skirt, <i>toupée</i> and all.
</p>

<p>
"While in London, Basil, remember
that you make our house in Piccadilly
your home."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Our!</i>" thought I in perplexity, as
two soft hands held mine during this
speech, and two blue eyes looked kindly
into mine.  I was becoming a timid fellow
again, or I know not what privilege of
cousinship I might have claimed had we
been elsewhere than amid that crowd at
Kensington Palace-gate.
</p>

<p>
"I live in Piccadilly with an old
lady-friend, or rather, I should say she lives
with me&mdash;my companion, an officer's
widow.  You will lunch with us
to-morrow&mdash;two is the hour, and we shall
expect you.  Adieu."
</p>

<p>
She was borne off at a trot by her
chairmen in the Gauntlet livery, while
I set out on foot to return to "mine inn,"
the King George the Third, in Pall Mall.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><br />
COUSIN AURORA.
</h3>

<p>
I felt pleased and flattered by the
whole events of the day; especially by
the beauty, the charming frankness of
Aurora, and the decided preference she
showed for me; the more so that she was
an object of no little attraction to the
powdered beaux who crowded the court of
the young king.  And to think that my
poor red coat eclipsed all their finery.
</p>

<p>
Betimes next day I had my hair dressed
by a fashionable perruquier; I took a
promenade in Pall Mall, and left a card for
a friend at White's Chocolate House.  He
was a brother of Douglas of ours, and
belonged to the Scots Foot Guards, but was
absent recruiting in Edinburgh.  About
mid-day, I presented myself at my cousin's
mansion, old Sir Basil Gauntlet's town
residence, in Piccadilly.  It was one of
the largest and best style of houses in
that fashionable quarter.  Master John
Trot appeared at the door in answer to
my summons, and opened it wide enough
and with a sufficiently low bow, as I had
exchanged my old, weather-beaten and
bloodstained fighting-jacket, for a fashionable
suit of French grey velvet, laced with
silver.
</p>

<p>
I found Aurora in the drawing-room,
with her companion, a pleasing old
gentlewoman in a towering <i>toupée</i>, high
red-heeled shoes and black lace mittens&mdash;Madam
Blythe (as she was named in the
old Scoto-French fashion) a widow of the
captain-lieutenant of Lord Ancrum's
dragoons, who had been killed in action, so
the poor woman's heart warmed towards
me as a gentleman of the cloth.
</p>

<p>
After a few of the ordinary remarks
about the weather, followed by a few
more about the ceremony of yesterday,
luncheon was announced by John Trot,
and we descended by a splendid staircase,
hung with effigies of departed Gauntlets,
depicted by Lely and Kneller, in wigs
and corslets, to the dining-room, past a
line of servants in livery, aiguiletted
and covered with braid, like state trumpeters.
</p>

<p>
Over the carved marble mantelpiece
hung a portrait of an old gentleman, in a
square-skirted coat, corded with gold, a
voluminous wig and wide riding-boots,
in the act of grasping the reins of a roan
charger.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis dear old grandpapa's portrait,
painted by Mr. Joshua Reynolds."  (He
had not been knighted yet.)
</p>

<p>
"One of the most rising artists in
London," added Madame Blythe, in an
explanatory tone.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis very like you, Basil," said
Aurora, laying kindly on my shoulders a
plump white hand that glittered with
turquoise and diamond rings.
</p>

<p>
I did not feel flattered, as "dear old
grandpapa's" Bardolph's snout was
somewhat like an over-ripe peach; but
altogether, in his jolly obesity he in no way
resembled the old <i>ursa-major</i> I had
pictured him&mdash;perhaps Mr. Reynolds
flattered.  However, I could scarcely
refrain from frowning at it when Aurora
did not observe me, and when I thought
of the will which he and old Nathan Wylie
had concocted between them; and then
of the handsome legacy&mdash;one shilling
sterling coin of this realm&mdash;bequeathed to
me when quartered at Portsmouth.
</p>

<p>
"My brother Tony&mdash;poor unfortunate
Tony!&mdash;hangs opposite in his green
hunting dress&mdash;another of Mr. Reynolds'
efforts," said Aurora.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, indeed!" said I, attending to my
ham and chicken, and turning my back
upon the portraiture of Cousin Tony, who
looked out of the gilded frame very much
as he did on that afternoon when he and
his grooms Dick and Tom laid their whips
across my shoulders near Netherwood
Hall.
</p>

<p>
"What length of time do you mean to
spend in London?" asked Aurora, amid
our desultory conversation.  "Your health,
cousin, and welcome home," she added, as
John Trot filled my glass.
</p>

<p>
"I shall spend my six months' leave.
I have no friends to visit, and nowhere
to go, cousin, unless back to my regiment."
</p>

<p>
"Six months&mdash;delightful!  Now, Basil,
with your figure and pretensions, I am
sure we shall find a charming if not a rich
wife for you.  Shall we not, Madame Blythe?"
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, Aurora.  A rich one I would
need, with my poor sub's pay," said I,
with a smile.
</p>

<p>
I glanced involuntarily round me, and
the splendour and luxury, the evidence of
ample wealth&mdash;wealth of which I had
cruelly been deprived&mdash;galled and fretted
me.  Furtive though the glance, it was
so expressive that Aurora coloured, and
but said, smiling&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What think you of the Lady Louisa
Kerr, the Countess of Ancrum's eldest
daughter?  She spoke much about you,
and was at the drawing-room, in blue,
flowered with silver."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, I have no idea of casting my
eyes so high."
</p>

<p>
"Or so <i>far off</i>," added Madame Blythe,
archly.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you have left your heart in
Germany?"
</p>

<p>
"On the contrary, I have brought it
back safe and sound, cousin.  More
wine&mdash;thank you, yes."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis some of the last of dear old grandpapa's
favourite port," said Aurora, making
a sign to Mr. Trot.
</p>

<p>
"But there is time enough yet for me
to think of marrying, Aurora."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you agree with Shakespeare, that
</p>

<p>
  "'A young man married, is a man marrèd,'"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Nay, dear cousin; I am not so ungallant;
but <i>àpropos</i> of Shakespeare, shall
we go to the play to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"In that I am your servant; but you
shall dine with us; a drive in the park, and
then the play after."
</p>

<p>
Aurora was charming; and it was impossible
not to be guided by her wishes in
everything.
</p>

<p>
At that time I was in excellent funds.
I had my pay as lieutenant of dragoons
(not that it was much, Heaven knows! to
cut a figure upon); but I had a good share
of prize-money, and a share in brass guns
taken in the affairs of Emsdorff and
Zierenberg, with a fair slice of a military
chest that found its way quietly, sans
report, into the pockets of the Scots Greys,
all enabled me to take Aurora and Madame
Blythe to Vauxhall, Ranelagh, the
tea-gardens, the opera, the play, and always
with a fair escort of flambeaux to dine
with his Grace of Argyle, or to a drum at
my Lady Ancrum's; to turn a card at
White's when I felt so disposed, and to
throw vails to those greedy vultures&mdash;the
servants&mdash;a folly at that time in excess.
</p>

<p>
As we issued from the house to the
carriage for our drive in the park, Aurora
responded to the profound bow of a
gentleman who rode past.
</p>

<p>
"That is a young Irishman who was
known about town as the Penniless
Adventurer," said she; "yet he wrote a
charming book on 'The Sublime and
Beautiful.'"
</p>

<p>
"Edmund Burke," I exclaimed, looking
after him with admiration; "is that the
great Edmund Burke?"
</p>

<p>
"Even so, with his hair all frizzed up.
How oddly he wears it," said Aurora, as
we seated ourselves, and Mr. Trot, after
shutting the door, perched himself on the
footboard behind.
</p>

<p>
At night Drury Lane Theatre presented
a scene of brilliance and splendour to
which I had long been unaccustomed.
Aurora was exceedingly gay and sparkling
with youth, beauty, and jewels&mdash;bowing
to people of good fashion in almost every
box&mdash;always happy and with considerable
readiness of wit, remarking several turns
of the play and peculiarities of personages
who were present, and in whom, she
thought, I might feel interested.
</p>

<p>
The first piece, I grieve, my prudish
friends, to state was Howe's tragedy of
"The Fair Penitent," which drew tears
from all the brocaded dames in the boxes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. David Garrick, the manager,
appeared as Lothario in a full-bottomed
perriwig, square-cut blue coat with buttons
in size like saucers, white rolled stockings
and square toed shoes.  Mrs. Pritchard
was the frail Lavinia; and sarcastic old
Macklin, who hated the Scots so much,
made up by pads and paint as a youth,
played the part of Horatio to the great
admiration of the pit, and particularly of
one group, among whom Aurora pointed
out to me a poet named Churchill and
Dr. Johnson the great Lexicographer.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Garrick's laughable farce of the
"Lying Valet" followed.  A sentinel of
the Foot Guards, with bayonet fixed and
musket shouldered, stood at the end of
the proscenium during the whole
performance, at the conclusion of which, the
manager and pretty Mrs. Pritchard, were
called before the curtain amid a storm of
applause.
</p>

<p>
At the door of the box-lobby we had
some confusion; a hundred voices were
shouting "Chair! chair!&mdash;coach, coach!" at
once, and an irritable old gentleman with
a very red face, drew his sword to clear
the way before his party of ladies.
</p>

<p>
"Who is this passionate personage?" I
inquired.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis Admiral Forbes," said Madame
Blythe, "the only Lord of the Admiralty
who <i>refused</i> to sign poor Admiral Byng's
death warrant."
</p>

<p>
"A Scotsman, like yourself, Basil," said
Aurora smiling.
</p>

<p>
I escorted the ladies home to Piccadilly,
and assisted them to alight from their
sedan chairs.  As the links were
extinguished, and Aurora's cheek was very
near mine, I&mdash;but as it is wrong to kiss
and tell, I shall close this chapter, and
with it my third day in London.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap22"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><br />
THE LAST.
</h3>

<p>
I found in Aurora an inexpressibly
charming friend and companion; thus at
times, in my heart, and before my funds
waxed low, I completely forgave her for
being the holder, the golden-haired usurper
of all that was mine by right of inheritance.
</p>

<p>
But there were other times when the
old emotions of pique and anger&mdash;the old
memories of wrong inflicted, and of
mortifications endured by my parents and myself,
blazed up within me, and made me resolve
to tear myself away from London and from
the silken toils that were netting round
me, and vow to rejoin my regiment, which
was now at winter quarters at Barentrup,
in Germany.
</p>

<p>
Still I hovered between Pall Mall and
Piccadilly, and when we were not at some
place of amusement (whither we sometimes
ventured <i>without</i> the matronage of
Madame Blythe), Aurora's drawing-room
was my evening resort; for after dining
at White's or at the George in the Mall
I always dropped in to take "a dish of
tea," as the Londoners phrased it, at that
little <i>guéridon</i>, or tripod table, with its
oval teaboard of mahogany, its diminutive
cups of eggshell china, filled with that
fragrant, and then expensive beverage,
the honours of which old Madame Blythe,
in her hoop petticoat, black mittens, and
toupee, dispensed so gracefully.
</p>

<p>
So passed the time swiftly in amusements
and gaiety.  My exchequer I have
said was waxing low.  My share in the value
of his Most Christian Majesty's brass guns
and mortars had all vanished at Vauxhall,
Ranelagh, and elsewhere, and my leave of
absence was drawing to a close.  The
latter tidings I communicated to Aurora,
and she seemed to be disturbed by them&mdash;so
much so, that I felt quite pleased
and flattered by her affectionate
friendship.  Had she wept I would have been
delighted.
</p>

<p>
How strange was this tie of cousinship!
Here was Aurora, one of the loveliest
girls in London (which, my good reader, is
saying a good deal), treating me like a
friend&mdash;a brother; and she was nearer
and dearer to me than friend or sister
could be, so far as regard and propinquity
went; yet withal, she was little more than
a recent acquaintance.
</p>

<p>
It was perilous work, those daily visits
to Piccadilly, and yet so pleasing; and
so&mdash;and so the reader may begin to
perceive the end of all this; but not exactly
how it came about.
</p>

<p>
I own that I fell in love with my
beautiful cousin; so had many others&mdash;among
them Shirley; and I could pardon
him now.
</p>

<p>
I am sure that dear old Madame Blythe,
who loved me like a son, for no better
reason than that I was a lieutenant of
dragoons, as her husband had been in
their lover-days, suspected what was going
forward.  She was discreet&mdash;oh, very
discreet!  She never opened the drawing-room
door too suddenly if we were within,
but always lingered without and loudly
issued an order to the cook, or to John
Trot; or dropped something noisily;
called to her French poodle, or played
nervously with the door-handle, until
Aurora and I laughed at her policy or
politeness, which you will.  However,
when she entered, I was generally to be
found on the side of the room opposite to
that occupied by Aurora.
</p>

<p>
When in the dining-room, the sight of
Sir Basil's portrait, and Squire Tony's too,
always roused my secret anger; thus, when
Aurora one day said to me playfully&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Cousin Basil, what do you think Lady
Ancrum tells me gossips say?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't know, really," replied I,
briefly.
</p>

<p>
"That I am setting my cap at you!"
</p>

<p>
"Zounds! at a poor devil like me!"
I exclaimed, almost gruffly.  "Nonsense,
Aurora!  Besides, you don't wear a cap."
</p>

<p>
Aurora coloured, and her sweet face
became clouded by my brusque manner.
</p>

<p>
But her remark set me thinking
seriously.  I had undergone some quiet
quizzing from Madame Blythe, who
believed in her heart that we were made for
each other, and that no two young people
could play a game of picquet, ombre, or
chess, or dance a minuet together, without
falling straightway in love; so this and my
Lady Ancrum's gossip set me, I say, to
think angrily, and when in such a mood,
Sir Basil's insulting last will and testament,
like the handwriting on the wall at
Belshazzar's feast, always seemed to flame
before me.
</p>

<p>
I was conscious too that my cousinship
and constant appearance in public with
Miss Gauntlet had scared away a score of
danglers and admirers, who being most
of them mere macaronies, or "pretty
fellows," were weak enough to leave me
entire possession of the field.  One or two,
indeed, threatened to invite me to breathe
the morning air at the back of Montague
House, but somehow never put their
war-like threat into execution.
</p>

<p>
I loved Aurora dearly; but the regard
I bore her was quite unlike the wild and
romantic passion with which the artful
Jacqueline had so suddenly inspired me,
for it was based upon friendship and a
knowledge of each other&mdash;upon strong
confidence and thorough esteem.  Could
more than these four ingredients be
wanted to make any marriage happy?
</p>

<p>
It was not a passion likely to expend
itself, and leave rosy little Cupid's wings,
bows, arrows and all, insolvent at the end
of the first year; yet withal, pride and a
sense of injury rankled deeply in my
heart.
</p>

<p>
I had never told Aurora that I loved
her, but she knew it well, and that she
loved me I was vain enough to believe;
still the idea stung me to the soul that
gossips might say that I, the disinherited
and penniless cousin married the rich one
to regain my lost patrimony.
</p>

<p>
"I shall not endure it," thought I,
"and so shall pack my traps and be off
to the regiment!"
</p>

<p>
One evening I was seated alone by the
library fire in Piccadilly, full of loving, of
angry, and of doubtful thoughts which
tormented me, when Aurora entered
gently, and leaning over the back of my
chair placed her pretty hands over my
forehead and eyes in sport.
</p>

<p>
"How you stare into the fire, Basil!
You will quite spoil your eyes.  What do
you see there?"
</p>

<p>
"I am reflecting&mdash;thinking&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Of the fancied battles you see among
the embers&mdash;the value of coals, or what?"
she asked, laughing.  "Now tell me, about
what were your precious thoughts?"
</p>

<p>
"They were of <i>you</i>, Aurora," said I, in
a troubled voice, while taking her dear
hands in mine; "my leave of absence&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Again, that horrid leave&mdash;well, Basil?"
</p>

<p>
"Is nearly at an end, and I must quit
London, rejoin, tear myself from this," I
replied, impetuously, and then added,
with sudden softness; "I love you, dear
Aurora&mdash;you know well that I do; but
never shall it be said by the world that I
married you for your fortune&mdash;as&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The world!" said she, interrupting
me, with an air of extreme annoyance,
while casting down her eyes and
withdrawing her hands; "but am I then so
plain&mdash;so unattractive&mdash;that no one would
marry for anything else, save for this
unlucky Netherwood&mdash;eh, cousin?" she
added, smiling with a charming air of
coquetry.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Aurora&mdash;I wish you could see
into my heart!"
</p>

<p>
"And you love me?" said she, in a
low and tremulous voice.
</p>

<p>
"Dearly&mdash;most dearly!"
</p>

<p>
"Then if I married you, cousin Basil,"
she resumed, looking smilingly into my
eyes, "might not the world say it was
for your title?"
</p>

<p>
"Am I then so plain and unattractive,"
I was beginning, when she playfully put
her hand on my mouth; "Aurora, of the
baronetcy I cannot divest myself."
</p>

<p>
"But I can <i>divest</i> myself of Netherwood,"
she exclaimed, and sprung from
my side with flashing eyes.  Then with
tremulous hands she unlocked an ebony
cabinet, and after a rapid search, came to
me with a folded document, saying,
"Look, Basil, do you know this handwriting?"
</p>

<p>
"It is that of old Nathan Wylie, our
grandfather's solicitor; I should know it
well."
</p>

<p>
"Then read this paper, which he prepared
and drew up a few weeks ago, at my
especial request."
</p>

<p>
I perused it with astonishment!
</p>

<p>
It was what is legally or technically
termed a "Disposition," by which Aurora
divested herself of Netherwood, lands,
estate, and everything, bestowing them
upon me during her lifetime, with
remainder to me and my heirs at her
decease.
</p>

<p>
I had learned enough of law during my
residence with old Nathan Wylie, the
framer of this new document, to know
how full, ample, and generous it was, and
while I rapidly scanned it from the
preamble at the beginning to the signature
of Aurora at the end, she stood near
me with her cheeks flushing, her eyes full
of tears, and her poor little hands
trembling.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Aurora!" I exclaimed in bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
"Now cousin, do you believe me&mdash;now
do you deem me sincere in wishing, at
every risk, to soothe your angry pride?"
she asked, with a shower of nervous tears.
"None can now say that you wedded me
to recover a lost patrimony, for yours it
was, and is, most justly."
</p>

<p>
"Dearest Aurora, I would rather owe
its restoration in another fashion, but still,
my beloved, to you.  Behold!" and I put
the deed in the fire, where it shrivelled
and was consumed in a moment.
</p>

<p>
I had no more words for the occasion,
but pressed Aurora to my breast.  I felt
that she was indeed my own&mdash;all my own;
that we should be all the world to each
other, and that our future would be a life
of love.
</p>

<p>
My lips could not express the debt of
joy and gratitude I owed to this dear girl;
but though silent, friend reader, they were
not perhaps idle.
</p>

<p>
Thus, without any tremendous effort
of romance, but in the most ordinary and
matter-of-fact way in the world, my
marriage came about with cousin Aurora.
She was to be my wife, and no
Frenchwoman, after all.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
And now, leaving Aurora and Madame
Blythe deep in all the mystery of paduasoy
skirts, calimanco petticoats, satin sacques,
solitaires and négligées, head-cushions and
red-heeled shoes, furbelows and flounces,
bracelets, neckets, étui and appendages,
long stomachers, clocked stockings, and
other things which I need not enumerate&mdash;in
short, arranging the full wardrobe of
a wealthy and beautiful bride, while I
depart to arrange all about the special
licence and extended leave (taking the
Horse Guards <i>en route</i>), I shall bid my
friend, the reader, who has accompanied
me to this happy conclusion, for a time,
perhaps, a kind adieu.

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
